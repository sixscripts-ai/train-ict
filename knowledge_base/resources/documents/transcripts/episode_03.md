# Episode 3: Internal Range Liquidity & Market Structure Shifts

## Market Structure Shift (MSS)
- **Definition**: A break of structure that signifies a reversal.
- **Constraint**: MSS is only valid *after* price has taken out liquidity (Swept a High/Low).
- **Usage**: Look for MSS to confirm the sweep, then enter on the retracement.

## Order Blocks
- **Definition**: A change in the state of delivery. A series of candles into buyside or sell-side liquidity.
- **Clarification**: Not every down candle is a bullish OB. It must be near a key level (Liquidity/FVG).

## Entry Refinement (Multiple FVGs)
When there are two FVGs in the displacement leg:
1. **Aggressive**: Enter on the *highest* FVG (first one price hits on retracement).
   - *Risk*: Price might stab deeper into the lower one.
2. **Conservative**: Wait for price to trade into the *lower* FVG. If it reacts and moves back up into the higher FVG, enter there.

## Key Session Times (EST)
- **London**: 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM
- **New York**: 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Equity Open at 9:30 AM is key)
- **Asia**: 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM

## Rules of Thumb
- "Look for the low hanging fruit" (Nearest liquidity target).
- Best time for *this* model: **8:30 AM - 11:00 AM**.
- If trading PM Session: Wait for **1:30 PM**.
