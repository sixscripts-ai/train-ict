# Episode 8: Forex Nuances

## Asset Classes
- **Yen Pairs**: Michael dislikes them (often cleaner price action on GBP/USD or EUR/USD).
- **Futures Analysis**: When trading Forex pairs (e.g., EURUSD), look at the Futures chart (6E) for volume/data confirmation if possible.

## Cross-Asset Analysis
- Analyzying EUR/JPY? Look at 6E (Euro Futures) and 6J (Yen Futures) to see which currency is driving the move.
