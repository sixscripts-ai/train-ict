# Episode 4: Macro View & Journaling

## The Setup
- **8:30 AM Rule**: Look for old highs/lows to be swept *at or after* 8:30 AM EST.
- **Journaling Requirements**:
  1. Time from MSS to FVG entry.
  2. Time from Entry to Profit Target.
  3. Drawdown duration/amount.

## Nuance
- The model forms specifically after the liquidity sweep. Don't force it if the sweep hasn't happened.
