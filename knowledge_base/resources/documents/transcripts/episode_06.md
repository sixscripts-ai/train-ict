# Episode 6: FVG Nuances & Opening Runs

## Fair Value Gap (FVG) Rules
- **Structure**: A 3-candle pattern.
- **Bearish FVG**: Candle 1 Low is *above* Candle 3 High. The gap is in between.
- **Validation**:
  - Valid Displacement MUST have an FVG inside the leg.
  - If no FVG forms, the displacement is weak/fake.

## The Opening Run (Judas)
- The first run after 9:30 AM NYSE Open is often false (Judas Swing).
- **Pro Tip**: Let the 9:30 candle form. Don't rush.

## Liquidity Objective
- Always ask: "Where is the opposing liquidity?"
- If you catch a Long, your target is the Buy-side Liquidity (Stop loss cluster above highs).
