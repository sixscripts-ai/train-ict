# Episode 9: Orderblocks & PM Session

## Bullish Orderblock (Refined)
- **Definition**: Consecutive down-close candles *prior* to a strong up move.
- **Key Condition**: The up move *must* create a Fair Value Gap (FVG). If there's no FVG, the OB is suspect.

## London Continuation
- If London Session (2-5 AM) had a huge expanded move:
  - **AM Session (NY)**: Might just chop/consolidate.
  - **PM Session**: Look for the "Distrubtion" phase or a retracement into discount.
- **Opening Range**: If price is far from the 8:30 Open, allow it to retrace back towards it before entering.
