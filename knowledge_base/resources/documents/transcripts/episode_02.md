# Episode 2: Elements To A Trade Setup

## Core Concepts
- **Price Delivery**: Price targets *Liquidity* (Stops) and *Imbalances* (Fair Value Gaps).
- **Stop Hunts**:
  - Whenever lower prices are expected, anticipate a stop hunt on buy stops (Judas Swing) before the drop.
  - Vice versa for bullish bias.
- **Timeframes**:
  - **1m, 2m, 3m**: Best for spotting imbalances (FVGs) in indices.
  - **5m**: Good for structural context, but leaves room for hidden imbalances.

## The Setup Rules
- **Entry**: Limit order at the Fair Value Gap (FVG).
- **Stop Loss**: Placed at the next candle's high/low *above/below* the FVG context.
- **Take Profit**: At the opposing liquidity pool (old high/low).

## Premium vs Discount
- Use Fibonacci to split the range (Swing High to Swing Low).
- **Above 50%**: Expensive (Premium) -> Look for Shorts.
- **Below 50%**: Cheap (Discount) -> Look for Longs.
- *Insight*: The algorithm pushes price from Premium to Discount and back.

## Key Time Window
- **8:30 AM EST to 11:00 AM EST**: The "Sweet Spot" for this model.
