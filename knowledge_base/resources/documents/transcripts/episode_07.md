# Episode 7: Risk, SMT, & Counter-Trend

## Risk Management
- **Rule**: Risk < 1% per trade.
- **Preservation**: It's better to miss a trade than lose capital.

## Counter-Trend (CT) Trading
- **Warning**: Trading against the Daily Bias is high risk.
- **Adjustment**: If you MUST trade CT, target smaller/nearest liquidity pools (5m/1m structure) and exit fast.

## SMT Divergence
- **Usage**: Confirmation only. Not a standalone signal.
- **Logic**: If ES makes a Lower Low, but NQ makes a Higher Low (at a support level), that is Bullish SMT. The cracking correlation suggests smart money accumulation.
