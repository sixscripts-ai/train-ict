# Episode 10: Power of 3 & Timeframes

## Power of 3 (PO3)
- **Phases**:
  1. **Accumulation**: Near the Open.
  2. **Manipulation**: False move (Judas) away from true direction.
  3. **Distribution**: The real trend run.
- **Target**: Catch the manipulation leg that terminates at a Key Level.

## Multi-Timeframe Checks
- **1m vs 3m**: If a FVG exists on the 3m, use it. Don't zoom in to 1m to find a "better" one if the 3m is clear.
- **Hierarchy**: Higher Timeframe (5m/3m) > Lower Timeframe (1m).

## Complex Entries
- **Breaker + FVG**: If a FVG overlaps with a Breaker Block, this is "High Probability Confluence".
- **Multiple FVGs**:
  - Bearish: Can enter on the lower one, but Stop Loss must be above the *higher* one to be safe.
  - Bullish: Can enter on the higher one, but Stop Loss must be below the *lower* one.
