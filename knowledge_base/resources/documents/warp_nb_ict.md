In the Inner Circle Trader (ICT) methodology, "models" refer to structured frameworks or setups used to identify high-probability trading opportunities. These models are based on understanding market structure, order flow, liquidity, and institutional behavior. Here’s an in-depth look at the various ICT models and how they are used in trading:

### 1. **ICT Order Block Model**
The Order Block Model is one of the core concepts in ICT trading. It identifies areas on the chart where institutions have placed large orders, creating significant support or resistance levels. These are often the last bullish or bearish candles before a strong move. Traders use these blocks as zones for potential trade entries or exits.

- **Bullish Order Block:** The last bearish candle before a strong upward move. Once price returns to this block, it often acts as support.
- **Bearish Order Block:** The last bullish candle before a strong downward move. When price revisits this block, it often acts as resistance.

**How to Trade It:**
- Look for price to return to the order block after the initial move.
- Enter a trade in the direction of the original move, using the order block as a support/resistance level.
- Set stop losses just beyond the order block.

### 2. **ICT Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) Model**
The OTE Model is a refined entry technique used to identify ideal entry points after a significant price move. This model focuses on retracements, typically between 61.8% and 79% Fibonacci levels.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify a significant market move (either up or down).
- Use Fibonacci retracement levels to measure from the high to low (or low to high) of the move.
- Look for price to retrace to the OTE zone (61.8% - 79%).
- Enter the trade in the direction of the original move when price reaches this zone.

### 3. **ICT Market Structure Shift Model**
This model focuses on identifying key shifts in market structure, which can signal the beginning of a new trend or a reversal. The model relies on the concept of swing highs and swing lows, looking for breaks in these levels to confirm a market structure shift.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify the current market structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range).
- Watch for a break of significant swing highs or lows.
- After a break, wait for a retracement to the previous structure level, often near an order block.
- Enter the trade in the direction of the new trend, setting stops just beyond the retracement level.

### 4. **ICT Power of Three (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) Model**
This model describes the typical behavior of price in three phases:
1. **Accumulation:** A period of consolidation where institutions accumulate positions.
2. **Manipulation:** A false move designed to trigger stop losses or trap traders in the wrong direction.
3. **Distribution:** The true directional move, often leading to a significant price trend.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify the accumulation phase as a range-bound market.
- Watch for a manipulation move (e.g., a false breakout or breakdown).
- Enter the trade after the manipulation, aligning with the expected distribution phase.
- Set stops near the accumulation zone's extremes.

### 5. **ICT Liquidity Grab Model**
The Liquidity Grab Model involves recognizing areas where the market is likely to hunt for liquidity, such as around previous highs or lows where stop-loss orders are clustered. After triggering these stops, the market often reverses direction.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify potential liquidity zones (previous swing highs/lows).
- Wait for the market to make a sharp move into these zones.
- Enter the trade after observing a reversal or rejection from the liquidity zone.
- Place stops just beyond the liquidity zone.

### 6. **ICT Breaker Block Model**
The Breaker Block Model is similar to the Order Block Model but focuses on the scenario where price breaks through an order block and then retraces back to it. The broken block then serves as a new support or resistance level.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify an order block and watch for a price break through it.
- Wait for price to retrace back to the breaker block.
- Enter the trade in the direction of the break, using the block as support/resistance.
- Set stops just beyond the breaker block.

### 7. **ICT Fair Value Gap (FVG) Model**
This model focuses on identifying and trading around Fair Value Gaps, which are price imbalances on the chart where there is a gap between the high of one candle and the low of the next without any overlap.

**How to Trade It:**
- Look for FVGs on the chart, often in the form of a gap between two candlesticks.
- Anticipate price to return to the FVG to "fill" the gap.
- Enter a trade when price reaches the FVG, aligning with the overall market trend.
- Place stops beyond the FVG zone.

### 8. **ICT Institutional Order Flow Model**
This model emphasizes aligning trades with the flow of institutional orders, often recognized by large, unidirectional moves in the market. The focus is on trading in the direction of these moves, using ICT tools like order blocks, liquidity grabs, and market structure shifts to find entries.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify the prevailing institutional order flow (e.g., a strong uptrend or downtrend).
- Use order blocks and liquidity zones to find entry points in line with this flow.
- Place stops and profit targets based on significant market levels influenced by institutional activity.

### 9. **ICT Judas Swing Model**
The Judas Swing Model describes a manipulation move typically occurring at the start of a trading session. This move is designed to lure traders into taking positions, only to reverse and trap them.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify the typical time for Judas Swings (often during the first hours of major trading sessions).
- Wait for an initial sharp move (the Judas Swing) and observe if it reverses.
- Enter the trade in the direction of the reversal after confirming the Judas Swing.
- Set stops near the extreme of the initial swing.

### 10. **ICT Time and Price Model**
This model emphasizes the importance of timing in relation to price levels. It combines specific times during the trading day with key price levels to identify high-probability setups.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify key times for trading opportunities (e.g., London Open, New York Open).
- Combine these times with key price levels like order blocks, liquidity zones, or FVGs.
- Enter trades when price reaches these levels during the specified times.
- Set stops based on market structure or recent swing points.

### 11. **ICT Asian Range Model**
This model focuses on the price range established during the Asian trading session, which often acts as a support/resistance zone for the London and New York sessions. The idea is to trade breakouts or reversals from this range.

**How to Trade It:**
- Mark the high and low of the Asian trading session.
- Watch for price to either break out of this range or reverse from it during the London or New York sessions.
- Enter trades based on the breakout or reversal, setting stops just beyond the Asian range extremes.

### 12. **ICT Mitigation Block Model**
The Mitigation Block Model is about identifying areas where institutions may have unfulfilled orders from previous moves. These blocks often act as strong support or resistance when revisited.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify a mitigation block as the last significant move before price reversed sharply.
- Watch for price to return to this block.
- Enter trades in the direction of the original reversal when price touches the mitigation block.
- Set stops just beyond the block.

### 13. **ICT Institutional Sponsorship Model**
This model is about recognizing when institutional traders are behind a move, which is often indicated by strong, consistent price movements and the breaking of key levels. The goal is to trade in the direction of these institutional moves.

**How to Trade It:**
- Look for evidence of institutional activity, such as large volume spikes, strong directional moves, and breaks of significant levels.
- Align trades with the direction of the institutional sponsorship, using ICT tools like order blocks and FVGs for entries.
- Place stops based on the assumption that institutional players will defend their positions.

### 14. **ICT Draw on Liquidity Model**
This model focuses on the market's tendency to move towards liquidity, such as stop-loss clusters or significant highs and lows. The idea is to trade in anticipation of these liquidity-driven moves.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify potential liquidity areas (e.g., previous highs/lows, round numbers).
- Anticipate price to move towards these areas to "draw" on the liquidity.
- Enter trades in the direction of the liquidity move, setting stops just beyond the liquidity zone.

### 15. **ICT AM/PM Session Model**
This model separates the trading day into AM and PM sessions, analyzing how price behaves differently in each. The focus is on capitalizing on the typical patterns that emerge within these sessions.

**How to Trade It:**
- Identify key levels and market behavior in the AM session (e.g., New York AM session).
- Use this information to anticipate moves in the PM session, often expecting a continuation or reversal.
- Enter trades based on the transition between sessions, using session-specific analysis to guide entries and exits.

These ICT models provide structured approaches to trading based on understanding institutional behavior, market structure, and liquidity. By applying these models, traders can enhance their decision-making process, aligning their trades with the underlying market dynamics.
