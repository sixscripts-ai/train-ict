# Macro Time Windows

Macro Time Windows are specific 20-minute periods during the trading day where the Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm (IPDA) actively seeks liquidity or rebalances price. These are "heartbeats" of algorithmic activity, often characterized by rapid expansion or reversals.

## The "Algo" Macros
**Definition:** Programmed execution times where volatility is injected.
- **Duration:** Typically 20 minutes.
- **Why They Matter:** Price often consolidates before a macro, then expands rapidly during it.

### Key Macro Times (New York Local Time)
The following times represent critical algorithmic injection points:

#### AM Session
1.  **09:50 - 10:10 AM:**
    - Often sets the high or low of the session after 9:30 AM equity open volatility.
    - Look for a Judas Swing here if 9:30 didn't deliver it.
    - This is the **Silver Bullet Macro**.
2.  **10:50 - 11:10 AM:**
    - Silver Bullet clean-up. Often reverses the 10:00 AM move or accelerates it into a target.

#### PM Session
3.  **11:50 - 12:10 PM:**
    - The "Lunch Injection". This macro often marks the beginning of the lunch hour consolidation or a reversal of the morning session.
4.  **13:10 - 13:40 PM:** (Note: Sometimes extends to 30 mins)
    - The "PM Injection". This ends the lunch consolidation and begins the afternoon trend.
    - Critical for AM/PM reversals.

## 90-Minute Cycles
**Concept:** The market moves in 90-minute harmonic cycles.
- **Origin:** Based on human biology (ultradian rhythms) and algorithmic reset periods.
- **Application:** Divide the trading day into 90-minute blocks starting at key reference times (e.g., Midnight, 8:30 AM). Expect major turning points or trend continuations at the boundaries of these cycles.

## Opening Gap
**Definition:** The difference between the closing price of one session (or day) and the opening price of the next.
- **Types:**
    - **Regular Trading Hours (RTH) Gap:** Gap between 16:15 close and 09:30 open (Futures).
    - **Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) Gap:** Gap between 17:00 close and 18:00 open (Futures).
    - **Weekend Gap:** Gap between Friday close and Sunday open.
- **Significance:** Gaps act as magnets (Draw on Liquidity) and support/resistance. The algorithm will often "spool" price back to fill the gap before continuing the trend.
- **Trading Rule:** "The Gap is a Map." If price is above the gap, the gap is support. If below, the gap is resistance.
