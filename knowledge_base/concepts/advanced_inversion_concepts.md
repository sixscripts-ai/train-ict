# Advanced ICT Concepts: Inversions & Balance

## Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG)
**Definition:** A Fair Value Gap (FVG) that has been respected as support/resistance but is later invalidated (closed through). Once broken, it "inverts" its polarity and acts as the opposite support/resistance.
- **The Logic:** When a Bullish FVG is broken (closed below), it becomes a Bearish IFVG. The market will often retest the low of that old FVG from below before continuing lower.
- **Why It Works:** It represents a shift in institutional sentiment. Where they previously defended price (FVG), they yielded. That yielding point becomes a reference for the new direction.
- **Entry Technique:**
    1.  Wait for a candle to *close* through an existing FVG.
    2.  Place a limit order at the *consequent encroachment* (50%) or the boundary of the old FVG.
    3.  Stop loss goes above/below the candle that broke the FVG.

## Balanced Price Range (BPR)
**Definition:** The result of aggressive two-way price action where a Fair Value Gap in one direction is immediately overlapped by a Fair Value Gap in the opposite direction.
- **Visual:** A large green candle leaves a Bullish FVG. The very next candle is a large red candle that leaves a Bearish FVG, and the two gaps overlap each other.
- **Significance:** This is the *strongest* form of rebalancing. Since price has been delivered rapidly up *and* rapidly down through the same range, the algorithm considers this area "efficiently balanced".
- **Trading Application:** Price often treats the BPR as a brick wall. It may wick into it, but bodies rarely close beyond it. It is a high-probability reversal zone.

## Reclaimed Order Block
**Definition:** An Order Block that was violated (price closed through it) but price later returns and respects it again in the *original* direction.
- **Context:** This usually happens during deep stop runs. Price smashes a Bullish OB to take sell-side liquidity, then immediately reverses. That "failed" OB is now reclaimed and acts as support again.
- **Significance:** Confirms that the move through the OB was a fake-out (Judas Swing) and not a true reversal.
