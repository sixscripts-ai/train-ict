# IPDA (Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm)

The **Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm (IPDA)** is the theoretical, automated system that drives price in the financial markets. According to ICT methodology, price is **not** random, nor is it driven purely by supply and demand from retail participants. Instead, it is engineered by a sophisticated algorithm designed to seek liquidity and rebalance inefficiencies.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Efficiency**: The algorithm seeks to efficiently price the asset. When price moves quickly (displacement), it often leaves behind inefficiencies (Fair Value Gaps) that must be revisited.
2.  **Liquidity Seeking**: The algorithm is programmed to move price toward areas of resting liquidity (Buy Side Liquidity above highs, Sell Side Liquidity below lows).
3.  **Time-Dependent**: IPDA operates on specific time cycles (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly) and intraday macros.
4.  **Manipulative**: It induces retail traders into the wrong side of the market (inducement) before moving to the true objective.

## The Functions of IPDA

IPDA has only two primary functions:
1.  **Seek Liquidity**: Run stops (Buy Stops or Sell Stops) to pair institutional orders.
2.  **Rebalance Imbalance**: Return to Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) to offer price at fair value to all participants.

## IPDA Data Ranges

IPDA references past price data to determine future delivery. These "Lookback Periods" are crucial for anticipating reversals or continuations:
*   **20 Days**: Short-term liquidity.
*   **40 Days**: Intermediate-term liquidity.
*   **60 Days**: Long-term liquidity and quarterly shifts.

## Trading Implication

Understanding IPDA means you stop viewing the market as a battle between bulls and bears and start viewing it as a delivery mechanism. Your goal is to align with the algorithm's objective:
*   Where is the liquidity?
*   Where is the imbalance?
*   What time is it? (Is the algorithm active?)

If you can answer these, you are tracking the IPDA.
