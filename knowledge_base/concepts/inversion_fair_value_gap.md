# Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG)

An Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG) is a Fair Value Gap (FVG) that price previously respected as support/resistance but has now violated and flipped roles. It is a powerful concept for identifying market structure shifts or continuations when price reclaims a level.

## Key Characteristics
*   **Failed Level:** Originally a Bullish FVG that price closed below, or a Bearish FVG that price closed above.
*   **Role Reversal:** Once violated, the "failed" FVG acts as the opposite force. A fail Bullish FVG becomes resistance (Bearish IFVG).
*   **Confluence:** Confirms that the algorithm has changed state from buy to sell or vice versa.

## Identification
1.  Identify a standard FVG.
2.  Wait for a candle body to close completely beyond the FVG boundaries.
3.  Upon return to this area, expect a reaction in the new direction.

## Trading Application
*   **Entry:** Use the "flipped" FVG as an entry point for a trade in the direction of the violation.
*   **Structure Confirmation:** A close through an FVG is often the first sign of a Market Structure Shift (MSS), even before a swing high/low is broken.
