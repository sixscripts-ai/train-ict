# Intermarket Analysis (DXY, Bonds, and SMT)

## SMT Divergence
**Definition (Smart Money Technique):** A discrepancy between correlated asset classes that signals algorithmic accumulation or distribution.
**Identification:** When one asset makes a Lower Low, but a correlated asset (expected to mirror it) fails to make a Lower Low (makes a Higher Low). This indicates relative strength/weakness.

**Types:**
- **Bullish SMT:**
    - Asset A (e.g., EURUSD) makes a Lower Low.
    - Asset B (e.g., GBPUSD) makes a Higher Low.
    - **Implication:** The market is accumulating longs. The Higher Low signals strength.
    - **Target:** The asset showing strength is prioritized for long setups.

- **Bearish SMT:**
    - Asset A makes a Higher High.
    - Asset B makes a Lower High.
    - **Implication:** The market is distributing shorts. The Lower High signals weakness.
    - **Target:** The asset showing weakness is prioritized for short setups.

## Correlated Markets (Pairs)
- **USDX (DXY) vs Foreign Currencies (EURUSD, GBPUSD):**
    - USD Strength -> EUR Weakness.
    - Look for SMT at Highs/Lows between DXY and EUR/GBP.
    - *Inverse Correlation:* DXY High should equal EUR Low. If DXY makes HH but EUR makes HL -> SMT.

- **Stock Indices (ES, NQ, YM):**
    - S&P 500 (ES) vs Nasdaq (NQ) vs Dow (YM).
    - If ES makes a Lower Low but NQ makes a Higher Low -> Bullish SMT.
    - **Application:** Use the stronger index for longs, weaker for shorts.

- **Interest Rate Yields (10Y/30Y):**
    - Rising Yields -> Generally Bearish for Indices/Gold.
    - Yield SMT can signal turning points in bonds/rates.

## Seasonal Tendencies
**Definition:** Historical patterns of price movement that recur annually.
**Application:**
- **Bullish Periods:** e.g., Early Jan, March-April (Tax Season), Late Oct-Dec (Holiday Rally).
- **Bearish Periods:** e.g., May ("Sell in May"), September (Statistically rough month).
- **Confirmation:** Use seasonal bias only as a confluence with Price Action, not a sole reason to trade.
