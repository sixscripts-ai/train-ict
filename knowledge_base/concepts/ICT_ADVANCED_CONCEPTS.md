# ICT Advanced Concepts: The "Missing Links"
*Supplement to ICT_MASTER_LIBRARY.md - Focus on 2023-2024 Mentorship Nuances*

## 1. Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG)
**Definition**: A Fair Value Gap (FVG) that has been *invalidated* (price closed through it) and is now respected as support/resistance in the opposite direction.
*   **Bullish IFVG**: A Bearish FVG that price closed *above*. Now acts as Support.
*   **Bearish IFVG**: A Bullish FVG that price closed *below*. Now acts as Resistance.
*   **Why it matters**: Often signals a sharp change in state of delivery (CISD) instantly.

## 2. Standard Deviations (The "Measure Move")
**Definition**: Using Fibonacci extensions to project specific liquidity targets after a manipulation leg (Judas Swing).
*   **Anchor Points**: Swing Low to Swing High of the manipulation leg.
*   **Projections**:
    *   **-1.5 SD**: First target / Partial.
    *   **-2.0 to -2.5 SD**: "Sweet Spot" for reversals (Turtle Soup).
    *   **-4.0 SD**: Maximum expansion (blow-off top/bottom).

## 3. Weekly Profiles (Market Maker Templating)
The algorithm usually follows a specific template for the week based on the opening price.

### Type A: "Classic Buy Day" (Low of Week on Tuesday)
1.  **Monday**: Accumulation / Range.
2.  **Tuesday**: Manipulation (False break low) -> Creates Low of Week (LoW).
3.  **Wed-Thu**: Expansion Higher.
4.  **Friday**: Distribution / Close.

### Type B: "Classic Sell Day" (High of Week on Tuesday/Wed)
1.  **Monday**: Rally or range.
2.  **Tuesday/Wednesday**: Manipulation (Judas Rally) -> Creates High of Week (HoW).
3.  **Thu-Fri**: Expansion Lower.

## 4. Propulsion Block
**Definition**: A highly sensitive Order Block *inside* a larger Order Block or OTE zone.
*   **Characteristics**: Candle body is heavily respected. Wicks do *not* go deep (unlike standard OBs).
*   **Usage**: Re-entry for adding size to a winning trade.

## 5. Rejection Block
**Definition**: A swing high or low with long wicks.
*   **Logic**: The "block" is not the body, but the *wick range* itself.
*   **Entry**: Targeting the *close* of the candle or the *start* of the wick, rather than waiting for a break of the absolute high/low.

## 6. Vacuum Block
**Definition**: A gap caused by a sudden price jump (event volatility) rather than algorithmic delivery.
*   **Trading**: Price treats this differently than an FVG. It often "fills" the vacuum completely quickly rather than respecting the 50% level.

## 7. Immediate Rebalance (IRB)
**Definition**: Price leaves a level and *immediately* (next candle) returns to tap the origin before continuing.
*   **Significance**: Signs of highly efficient, urgent algorithmic delivery. High confidence signal.
