Alright folks, welcome back to the ICT Mentorship Weekly Review. This is weekending March 22, 2019. We'll be looking at the Economic Calendar, General Commentary on the Dollar Index, Eurodollar, GBP, and the Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency, and Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency.
Okay, let's take a look at the Economic Calendar. Okay, so on Monday we have the IFO, Business Climate, 5 a.m. for Eurodollar. Tuesday, we have Building Permits and Consumer Confidence for the Dollar.
New York Session, Wednesday, New York Session, we have Canadian Dollar High Impact Trade Balance. On Thursday, we have Preliminary CPI for Eurodollar, and on the New York Session, we have Final GDP. And on Friday, we have Current Account GDP for British Pound, and Net Lending to Individual.
And E3 a.m., we have High Impact Canadian Dollar GDP, Core Price Index, and Personal Spending for the Dollar Index. 9.45, we have Chicago PMI, and we have Consumer Sentiment at 10 a.m., and then obviously the Parliament Brexit Vote, the ongoing drama that is Brexit. All right, so we're looking at the Dollar Index as a daily chart.
You see here we have a Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency right in here. At the time of this recording, I was recording it about a couple minutes before two o'clock, my time locally, on a Friday afternoon, trying to get a head start on the weekend, folks. But the market has tried to press up into that area in here.
Take a look at the lower time frame and see what has been left as a remainder of that CIBI. So again, CIBI is Sell-Side Imbalance, inefficient because it doesn't offer enough Buy-Side Imbalance. Not imbalance, imbalance.
So what I'm saying is this is all Sell-Side Delivery here. No real Buy-Side has been offered until we've come up into the range here. So once we trade back in, close this in, we'll have to determine at that time what the market may want to do.
Now before I go any further into the lower time frames, the mean threshold of this last up closed candle, if we trade through that on a closing basis, I will change gears on the Dollar Index and move to a bullish stance. Until that happens, I'm not bullish. Okay.
So I'm looking for bearish Dollar Index. And like I said, this thing can stay sideways and the other foreign currencies can move all over the place. I think that they're holding this for a longer term run above 100.
So that's, again, a long, long, long macro view of what I think the Dollar Index is trying to do. But obviously that'll change if we make a significant run below the January lows. We've gone over to the hourly chart for Dollar.
You see we have a Buy-Side Liquidity Pool here. Equal highs. Too clean.
Here's the closer version of that CIBI. Sell-Side Imbalance. Buy-Side Inefficiency.
We've rallied up into almost this entire range. It's left it open to some degree, and we'll look at that when we get to the 15-minute time frame. I'll talk about this little area in here.
This is called a Sell-Side Imbalance Volume Imbalance. All this price action in here. From this candle to here, we created a gap.
Whether you see the gap or not on your data is irrelevant because it's still there. It's acting in the same capacity as this wall over here. But when we have a missing body, a candle that didn't paint enough to create a body in an area of price action, or between two specific price levels, that's an imbalance on volume.
So there's a lack of trading there. Couple that with the idea that it's the same as you would see here. This is inefficient.
What makes this inefficient is because it's one quick sudden candle down. There isn't a lot of back and forth price action, for instance, like we see as the market trades lower here. What's the difference between this approach to delivering price back and forth as it drops, and this one? This is highly inefficient because it only offers a quick repricing lower.
Every price level between this candle's high and this candle's low did not get enough sufficient time made available to it so it could be traded. Now think about what I just said there. This candle, and from the period of which where it starts the candle and ends the candle, this entire candle price was not permitted to stay at a sufficient amount of time at a specific number of price points or levels inside of that total candle's range.
We're led to believe, by educators, we're led to believe by brokers, by whoever's supposed to know more than the rest of us, that all of this movement here is attributed to short selling. It's not. It's being completely controlled and it's manipulated.
These prices, if you sold short and you were a part of that move, it's easy to attribute that to say okay well it was I was on the right side with the sellers. There is no selling from the algorithmic standpoint. The algo is delivering price.
What we do as traders, at the bank level, or as retail traders, because we're all retail here, if we do not execute at those price levels, the algo doesn't care. It's moving around based on its programming. Over here, the difference how prices dropped lower is because it's much more efficient.
As drops down, it comes back. So it offers more of the range back and forth as it moves up and down offering price. Price makes a lower low and it comes back.
Moves lower, comes back. Moves lower, comes back. Moves lower, comes back.
So all of this range in here is much more efficient because it offered more time and it offered more availability to buy and sell side. More specifically, it offered more buy side delivery during the length of time. So what makes this inefficient again? The short span of time and this makes it efficient because of the long length of time.
So in other words, this range in here to here, so the high to low, if you look at this whole move from here to here, it's very close to it in terms of the number of pips. It's not identical. I'm not trying to argue that point, but I'm saying that if we look at the two contrasting price points from high to low, from high to low, this is highly inefficient.
These events are typically filled back in because the algorithm will want to come back up and offer, as you're seeing here, a measure of buy side delivery. When I say buy side delivery, that means an up movement in price. That's all I'm saying.
Now, ideally, we want to see a candle paint, okay, or create itself and then leave bodies inside of this area, not just wick up into it. That's important too. But the difference between this area here, which is a sell side imbalance, volume imbalance, okay, CIVI.
I say these four little acronyms because it's a lot easier to number one, say it, two, it makes you think about what's going on also. So when I have them in my charts, I'm communicating the fact that there is an imbalance. So there's a repricing so fast down here.
There's no sell side delivery at all. Again, your broker or your feed may not show this, and that's fine. But this essentially is the same thing that's going on many times in here, just because we see our candle paint an entire one big bar or candlestick.
Internally, this is what we're actually seeing that inefficiency. There's gaps like this in between price points. So this is actually a much more appropriate visual aid in terms of this, you know, deciding whether or not the market is efficient or if it's efficiently delivered because it's missing a complete area of price.
This gap needs to be refilled. Now, when price comes back up, it fills it and rebalances, doesn't it? No, it hasn't. It does not rebalance until it offers sell side delivery.
What did you just say? In this area here, from this candle's close to this candle's opening, buy side was offered to this price point here, leaving this area right in here, this gap as a civvy sell side imbalance volume imbalance. It's missing a chunk of data that would be offered in between those two price points or those price levels. Watch what happens in here.
Price runs up. Yes, it closes that gap, goes a little bit further. But now what does it have to do to be efficiently traded? It has to go back down in between this close and this candle's opening or to the wick high because buy side delivery is offered from the opening to this high.
So from this candle's high and this candle's close, there has to be sell side delivery. We get it here. Boom.
It also fills in a buy side imbalance here, comes down, closes it, and also hits an order block. So notice all the confluences of things occurring at that same price point. The teaching is highly specific to this area here.
There's missing sell side delivery. So when it comes back up, this is not the completion. That's not it.
It has to eventually come back down. Then we have officially rebalanced this price point. Remember institutional order flow as I teach it, IPTA, the interbank price delivery algorithm has to have balance.
It has to have balance. That means it must trade up through a price range and then back down through a price range. And once it does that, that range is now balanced.
Once a range is balanced, then equilibrium becomes a significant factor. But until then, equilibrium is not a factor at all. Okay.
So we have Civi rebalance here, and then price comes back up going into the Cibi sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency. You're going to want to watch this video a few more times. Okay.
So we went on into the 15 minute timeframe. Here's that Cibi here again, zoomed in. This is the entire range that's left exposed and open.
And it closes to this price point here, leaving this range here to this high unfilled. Then on this run here, it comes back all the way to this price point here and then leaves this little shaded area. That's slightly different in terms of color.
I guess that's going to be as close as I can get to referring to as pink. Maybe that, uh, I didn't pick pink. It just creates that because of the overlapping colors of this.
It is enough of a contrast to communicate to the method. Otherwise. So we're looking for a likelihood of coming back up into this area, closing in this sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency.
Once we trade to that, we'll have to determine whether or not it wants to go higher or lower. I believe it wants to go higher for that equal high. As we showed on the dollar hourly chart, we also have a gap in here.
Okay. So there's a volume imbalance as well. This is a Bivi buy side imbalance volume imbalance.
It's missing a little portion of price action. What type of price action is it missing sell side? So not only will price need to come back down, but it needs to come back up. And again, then this area here will be efficiently balanced.
You can actually see there's a missing portion of price action in here is a mission portion of price action in here. Again, all of these elements are synonymous with what we expect to see inside of these candles, but we don't necessarily see them because one single candle from open high loan close. If it's one candle, you won't see the breaks or the missing portions of price where it did not paint or offer those specific price levels.
That's why when we talk about dropping down into a lower timeframe, what I want you to do is inside of these single candles, many times there'll be smaller little breaks in between where there's one single candle. That is the area which IPTA will want to reprice to and rebalance that when we have a bias is an institutional order flow entry drill. And when you have context, correct and time of day, right.
And a day a week, right. And the long term or intermediate term bias, right. And you have the strongest pair when buying or the weakest pair when selling that as a complete system, you'll want to remind this portion of the video and listen to it again, because I just told you what you're listening and looking for.
Every time you watch a video, I've spelled it out for you. All right. So moving on over into the Euro dollar Euro dollar, we had our buy side liquidity pool mentioned last week as a objective.
That's where we were looking for price to go to what is residing above that old high it's buy side liquidity. That liquidity has been purged. Okay.
The OEB back up into this bearish order block. Now, why not this candle, Michael? It can be on this showing you the actual precision of the delivery, because this is sell side delivery. So we have to go back to from the left of when sell sides offered as an initial price move lower, we go back and where's the first up close candle.
It's this one here, but we look at a beefier body one here. So you can use this one. There's nothing wrong with that.
Specifically aiming on the open to the midpoint of the body in that range. That's going to be where the sensitivity is going to be here. This just so happens to offers the cleaner delivery for a bearish order block specifically.
In other words, I'm using, even though this is a larger body candle, this is smaller inside of it. So inside that's that larger body candle, it's going to be the smaller candle. Just like if we were looking at a smaller timeframe, we would reduce our focus down to the smallest up close candle, narrowing down into where the true order block is from the lowest timeframe, because you're going to be able to see the benefit of the lower timeframe is you can see when the inefficiencies are completed and the imbalances are rebalanced.
That's the only real benefit of intraday, but because most people are not taught and trained like you're being taught intraday charts, end up hurting them. It gives them a false impression. There's a lot more signals and setups.
That's really not there. So we come back up to the PIP beautifully delivered rate on the PIP, and then a repricing lower. I mentioned earlier on Wednesday's review.
I said that last week we talked about, or I talked about that. I'm going to be watching this area here. We'll see in a lower timeframe, how it struggled in that area.
And then finally price took off, hit our liquidity pool. And now we've come all the way back down in here is another nugget of wisdom as it relates to inefficiencies. No one's teaching what I'm teaching you in this video.
So I want you to understand that. And when you guys get in to social media and you're throwing my things around like they don't mean anything to you, they mean a whole lot to me. I've lost fortunes learning how to get this stuff.
And when you're just sitting around on social media and you're throwing them around, not only is it disrespectful, but you're actually giving away content that is really not meant for the public. So if you're learning this, just keep it to yourself. It really is.
It's just too good. It really is too good. So when we look at, so when we look at repricing price comes down from this low chart starts trading up.
If we look at how price is being delivered on the buy side between the separation of this candle here in this candle here, we have this one up close candle, the previous day's candle to the left of this one, the high comes to this price point here. The next day it opens trades down, but does not come back to this candles high. So this single pass on this one candle up, there is a buy side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
Same thing I said here, this candle only upside stops here on the high. This is Sunday. Then we have a trade higher.
This price range right in here on this single candle is a buy side imbalance sell-side inefficiency. So it's a busy. So the red levels that I have here highlighted, they are specific ranges of inefficiency price.
We'll want to go back down into them. Now they can be targets or they can be entry points. If we are going to see a higher dollar index price could drop down a little bit lower and come into this area and rebalance.
Once it does that, it's also the mean threshold of this down close candle here. And that could be something significant to cause support. It offered an opportunity to be a target here.
Once it filled its objective of running the liquidity here, HIPDA ran up, offered the price there, and then suddenly price went lower. Moving into the hourly chart, you can see that buy side liquidity pool here and the purge on that liquidity trading back up into a bearish order block. And if you go into lower timeframes, you'll see it nice little run away and come back up into bearish order block here.
Look how much time we spent struggling around that daily range. I said that I would be watching to see what we do when, how we trade around that. It wasn't until FOMC, you've seen price come up.
They use the FOMC to run the liquidity over here. We had a breakdown, small little sippy in here, sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency trades right back up into bearish order block. This is the PMI number for Euro.
It was disappointing. They had a number of 50 something in February and it came out to like 47 or something, maybe 48. It was lower than they were expecting.
The reaction here is all programming. It's repricing based on HIPDA. Yes, the number was bearish for Euro, but that's not the deciding factor.
And that's not the only thing that causes these types of moves. The reason why I teach you to economic calendar is because HIPDA will work specific macros around high impact news events. Now, there's also many times that you're going to see a very, really low impact news event that HIPDA will reprice aggressively against.
And you're thinking, wow, that wasn't expected to be that of a deal. And all of a sudden it was. It's not a measure of how much impact it is for HIPDA.
I just like to focus on the high impact to medium impact, because I know HIPDA will want to do certain things that I teach you and then hunt for liquidities above and below the marketplace relative to the idea. So in other words, we use the economic calendar as a volatility injection. Okay.
And the way of saying it cleaner and more easier to understand is it's a smokescreen hiding what the professional perspective is. So if you get caught up in the noise, like FOMC looked extremely bullish, rallied all up, it went right to where we say it was going to go before the week even started. Didn't spend much time up there and then ran away.
Nice little run up in here, efficiently traded, inefficiently traded comes back to the price point where it's efficiently traded and stops and moves lower. We have an inefficiency here. So we'll look at a lower timeframe in a moment, but here is that same range beautifully coming down into it up to the daily chart.
So that Siby is perfectly rebalanced there. And we have one more here on the lower timeframe, hourly chart rate below these equal lows that Siby also would complete. So we have a liquidity pool here, which is nice confluence.
So in a 15 minute timeframe, you can see how price trades aggressively lower. Okay. From this price point here, this is the old daily high.
That's what horizontal line is that old daily high that we were aiming for. And this was the run above that to run the buy-side liquidity. Okay.
So buy-side liquidity is purged. Price has a repricing. Does it have to come back up to this price point to rebalance? No, it only has to come back to this price point here.
So the gap really only exists between this low and this candle's high. It's important what I just said there. Why is that? Why isn't it? This whole area in here, Michael, why isn't it from this price point here to here? Because we worked a higher timeframe high.
That's a run through here. We came back and rebalanced it. Tried to rally again, this small little, you know, fractal rallying higher.
I would only look for this low to be traded up to as a rebalance. And it didn't do that, which means it can be left as a common gap. Price trades down, comes back up.
Doesn't quite get to that area. So that means this is a common gap or it could be a breakaway gap. Price trades lower, comes back in again.
So right away we're efficiently trading lower versus a rundown like this. Okay. Or a rundown like this or a rundown like this inefficient only from this price point here down.
We balance most of it inefficient. We rebalance right in here. Sell off again, rebalance, sell off again.
So now what's actually occurred in here. We have a balanced price range from here to here. And then we have a smaller range from here to here.
That's rebalanced. Why is it rebalanced? It's efficiently delivered on both sides up and down. There's been down close candles and then up close candles between the high and the low.
The bulk of that has been rebalanced. That range now can, you can use as an equilibrium price point. Equilibrium also gives us the middle point of this last up close candle, which is a bearish order block.
Extend that out. Bam. It's only off by one pip.
There's your PMI number coming out in London, 4 a.m. New York time. Boom. Explode to the downside.
Okay. The effects of efficiently delivered and inefficiently delivered price is something you're going to study. And I hype, I harp on it all the time.
It's maybe not something you're going to learn right away. And if you don't still get it, you'll get it because of the examples I'm talking about. Just know there's a stark contrast between how much time it takes up a price move from one level to another versus like this highly inefficient.
So inside of this area where price has been offered up, I watched this live as it happened. I think it only offered like four or five price levels. It was only like boom, boom, boom.
And it was already up here. So it has to come down and reprice offering sell side delivery. And once it does, then it can start to move back up and offer where there's gaps in here.
It'll refill on the upside until we get to an account counter and volatility injection occurs. Then the market will seek what? Another level of liquidity right in here. Perfectly delivered to the PIP.
That's that busy buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency relative to the daily chart right there. You don't see that on supply and demand. You don't see that in Chris Laurie's stuff.
You don't see that on anything except for here. This is institutional overflow. It's not depth of market.
You don't need ladders. You don't need point of control. You don't need volume.
You don't need all that stuff. Okay. Price is telling you everything you need to know.
If you understand what it's telling you, it's a language. Okay. Price is speaking in a language that is written in three different ways, accumulation, manipulation, and distribution.
It's vocabulary is open, high, low, and close. That's it. That's it.
And time and time is the variable. That's the part that's going to hurt you because you don't understand the, when, when is the imbalance going to occur? We don't know. The likelihood is when the volatility injection occurs relative to the economic calendar, but they can occur anytime.
But when we have that imbalance, it gives us opportunity. Okay. Moving on over into cable.
Now cable, this thing, I honestly, I don't know. I don't know. And I really want you to understand.
I don't know. So I want you to be very careful if you want to be smart. Okay.
Just stay out of it because this is nothing in here is high probability right now. They have a equal highs in here. They may want to run those obviously a liquidity pool here.
To me, I think they could still pump this thing higher and clear out the 13th high. But what we do from there, I don't know. And I want you to appreciate my honesty when saying, when saying this, because I'm learning as we go with Brexit.
And I'm glad that I keep a hands-off approach for the most part in it, because there's several times last week where I was looking at certain things in price that would have otherwise led me to get into a trade. And I didn't do it because it would have broke my protocol. I don't understand something like Brexit.
I don't. So because I don't understand it, I'm not going to stand in front of a Mack truck while it's barreling down a hundred mile an hour at me. I'm just not going to do it or stand in front of a train challenge it to knock me over.
It will. So because of that, I think it's important that you, if I'm not willing to touch it and you're learning how to do this, why would you ever consider doing it? If I'm telling you, I fear the, the stinger, okay. That may be embedded in me by this pair.
Why would you want to go? Well, I'm going to show him, you know, don't do that. This is one of those times where you just don't need to do those types of things. Okay.
When it's not a fundamental driver like Brexit going on, if you want to outperform me or out trade me, be my guest, but in here I'm trying to protect you. That's all I'm trying to say.
