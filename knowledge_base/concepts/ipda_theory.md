# IPDA (Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm)

## Core Concept
The **Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm (IPDA)** is the theoretical automated system used by central banks and large institutions to deliver price. Unlike retail theories of "supply and demand," IPDA operates on specific logical parameters: **Time** and **Price**.

**Primary Directive:** To seek liquidity (Buy-Side/Sell-Side) and rebalance inefficiencies (Fair Value Gaps).

## Characteristics
- **Efficiency:** IPDA seeks to make the market efficient. If price moves too quickly (imbalance), it will return to fill the gap.
- **Liquidity Seeking:** The algorithm is programmed to "attack" resting orders (stop losses) to facilitate institutional order filling.
- **Time Dependency:** IPDA operates on strict time cycles (Time of Day, Day of Week, Seasonality). "Time is more important than Price."

## Theoretical AI
The market is not random. It is engineered.
- **Macro Drivers:** Interest rates, geopolitical events, and economic data inputs feed the algorithm's bias.
- **Micro Delivery:** The tick-by-tick delivery is handled by the algorithm to induce retail sentiment and trap traders.

## Continuous Delivery
- **Buy Program:** When active, every down candle is for buying (discount).
- **Sell Program:** When active, every up candle is for selling (premium).

Understanding whether the IPDA is in a Buy Program or Sell Program is the essence of Daily Bias.
