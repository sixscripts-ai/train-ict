okay folks welcome back price action model number seven universal trading model and this teaching is going to 
specifically deal with sells side low resistance liquidity runs and 
fractals all right price action model number seven again this is Universal trading so it's applicable to every 
style of trading that means position trading swing trading shortterm trading day trading and 
scalping this model again is focusing on the sell side low resistance liquidity 
runs utilizing the fractal and our stage for this model is 
a liquidity draw in other words we're looking for a higher time frame level to 
absorb liquidity okay the setup set up is sell-side Market maker profile now 
because we have two Market maker profiles we have a buy model and we have a cell model both have a cell-side 
delivery in other words the portion of the model or profile that goes lower 
seeking liquidity that's what we're going to be focusing on for our setups for this model and the pattern itself is 
going to be referring to fair value it's a simple Goto 
okay so the sell side expansion on a market maker cell model 
when the chart and again this is any time frame presents us with a bearish condition for a market we have to 
understand when the market is poised to move lower based on a draw on 
liquidity as you see here on this crude depiction the market will seek a level 
of liquidity once it reaches is that it will have a tendency to move lower if 
the higher time frame indicates that it's feasible in other words if it's likely to occur this is how we're going 
to start stalking our setups now between the moment and price when we identify 
the liquidity the market will seek and the price level of the targeted liquidity in other words after this 
initial run up we're expecting the market to go lower so we need to Target a level of liquidity below the market 
once we determine that what that price level is this is our targeted liquidity and between those two price points is 
our range of opportunity so we have equal lows here so we know there's a sell-side liquidity pool resting below 
that and that would be our targeted liquidity the range of opportunity is 
shown here and there is one two areas of key points of liquidity 
because everything is gerine with the original buy side of the curve of our 
Market maker sell model here initially we have the run up the retracement back 
into the original consolidation so this is a return back to fair value we have an expansion move up trade back down 
again we don't look for classic support and resistance Theory here we're waiting for it to retrace back once the market 
gives us another buying opportunity in here it rallies up to an area of higher time frame liquidity once it reaches 
this liquidity and we are essentially bearish if you will uh we would expect 
to see price trade lower once we see the market break down 
below our highest reaccumulation of Longs okay and 
it's going to be this one here go back and watch model number six and you'll it'll refer to these specific price 
points where we get this low here we draw that out through the curve which is the 
midpoint of the overall fractal draw that out in time Market will look to seek to trade back to that level and 
then there will be a measure of distribution okay in other words cell side imbalances will start creating uh 
the movement lower large ranges down many times it doesn't need to go 
back up to this level here so for your notes just know that on a lower time frames like for instance a a 1 hour or a 
15minute time frame they don't necessarily have to come back to this one but if it doesn't that's fine 
because the second opportunity will create a larger more protracted 
expansion on the downside in other words there's going to be a larger degree of a price swing unfold than just reaching 
below the liquidity here okay and go back and listen to that portion again lots of nuggets in that segment of 
commentary so we're looking for opportunities to sell short here and sell short here initially targeting here 
now if we get a run significantly below this low here and it runs below the 
initial 0.1 of reaccumulation of Longs on a cell 
model on this Market maker sell profile if again the market breaks down right to 
this one okay now again looking at the overall structure every fractal every 
price swing is going to be slight different but the general theme and rule of thumb is the algorithm will seek this 
price point here or if it runs through this one other words if we get this price leg here all the way down and it 
blows right through this one then once it retraces back up inside of the down 
closed candles in this swing low okay once that occurs we're going to expect a 
large dynamic move farther than just this liquidity pull here on sell stops 
okay so let's move on okay we're looking at a weekly 
liquidity distribution profile and this is going to look similar to what we showed in the price action model number 
six over here we have the the last if you 
will on the reaccumulation of Longs on the sell side over here we match up 
where the buy side was offered in other words every time we created a bullish scenario to the left of the curve that's 
this vertical line here with the liquidity distribution profile what we're doing is and what I'm 
actually trying to communicate to you is the way the algorithm will seek to pair 
up previous levels of buy side and sell-side delivery over here during the the buy 
side of a market maker sell model once it creates that smart money reversal and 
notice I'm teaching the higher level in other words 
in terms of um probability because this level here takes some experience okay I 
don't want you thinking that you're going to be able to nail the high and then go short here and go short here and then go to the bank you 
know you just being all happy with no uh resistance if you will I want you to 
focus on the opportunities that reside with once the in the second of the buy 
side re acccumulation on a market maker sell profile once that's broken on the right side of the 
curve here what we're going to be doing is we're going to be looking for the market to create a pairing of orders in 
the form of a fair value Gap or where there was old sell stops over here below that swing low that would have created a 
new reaccumulation in there those cell stops they will get ran out out there we 
want to see that take place once those sell stops are ran out then I return 
back up into this level of liquidity in the form of the down closed candles that's where 
we're looking for to pair our orders for going short because there's going to be a form of mitigation there so words 
they're going to knock out the Longs that were rallying up here and trying to make profit they're they're stopped out 
then the market will return back the fair value the fair value is going to be determined by the down close candles 
that make up the swing low to the left of the curve of this overall expected 
price swing so in other words the theory is we're expecting price to go up to eventually go down so we're watching 
price accumulate and something over here we may have been able to go long on 
based on what we learned in price action model number six but even if we did not this is the the importance that I want 
you to understand understand the power in this Insight is that you don't have to be a buyer when 
the market trades up to this level here your whole profile and mo your model may be looking for this structure to to form 
and once it breaks down and trades below the second of the reaccumulation of the buy side of the curve on a sell-side 
Model okay and obviously this is going to take you a couple times to listen to 
but go back and look at Price action model number six and refer to the notes has been provided in the mentorship if 
we take out the second level of reaccumulation on the B side of the 
curve of a cell model once that occurs we have a high 
probability to see it seek the first initial reaccumulation of 
Longs in other words it doesn't show it here but I'm showing it in this form because I want you to know that this 
from a theory standpoint this would represent the higher of the two in other words we have a consolidation it runs up 
comes back down finds the retracement back to the original consolidation that would be point one of reaccumulation of 
Longs then it rallies up then retraces back down this is the second buying opportunity or reaccumulation of Longs 
then rallying up to some level of buy side liquidity to 
offset the Longs that you were seeing be accumulated here they're selling them 
here now you're not going to know without a great deal of experience where this is going to be the reversal and 
that's why I'm not teaching that because you have to look at things like I'm showing you here and then over time and 
experience that will teach you when to anticipate that smart money reversal okay so there will be times that you can 
go in and fish drop a small little position in here if you think that the uh the the likelihood of that formation 
of a eny term long-term high is forming you can put a really small position on there and then hopefully once it gets 
down here and creates the scenario that we're outlining here the higher of the two swing lows 
prior to the reversal here when that breaks that's our Market structure break 
we're not going to look at this small little short-term Market structure break that creates the lowrisk entry okay the 
lowrisk entry requires High experience okay you need to have a lot of experience to get to that but again I'm 
not trying to hold it back and say well you know you don't deserve it yet you do 
get it by experience but you get it by experience by doing what I'm showing you here so we're looking at the higher of 
the two reaccumulation and in some models there may be actually three accumulations there may one returns back 
to consolidation two reaccumulation it never reaches that buy side liquidity 
pool yet and then a third one creates that in that case again we're always using the higher between the original 
cons validation and where we thought that market would reach for liquidity whichever the higher of the 
reaccumulation of Longs is seen whatever that swing low is we want to see that be broken once the market seeks the 
liquidity below that runs the sell stop below that on the left side of the curve once that occurs and believe me I'll 
show you examples this in in price but nonetheless once the sell stops are taken then we wait for fair value to be 
traded back to in other words it could run the stops then come back up into the bodies of the down close candles of the 
Swing Low that's formed here again underline this in your notes if the 
highest reaccumulation of Longs on the buy side of the curve of a cell 
model in other words price is accumulated sideways it moves higher trades up and then goes down what we're 
looking for is that break in Market structure of the highest of the reaccumulation of Longs prior to a point 
of liquidity being taken out above an old high or uh some measure of a premium array and 
again go back and look at the market maker um models and overlap with that 
content from month number five where we talk about the PD array Matrix so we have that that model of 
breaking Market structure relative to a specific price point it's not just well 
it's going to be a break of Mark structure if it takes this low down or takes this High down know there very 
specific structure that's being shown here and that's what this liquidity distribution profile provides you this 
slide is something that will not be shown by anyone else okay the content 
that's being shown to you here is unique to me because of the institutional 
delivery of liquidity that aspect of retail learning and trading is void it 
doesn't exist okay okay so when we have folks that are suggesting that they have a order flow background or something to 
that effect or even supply and demand uh this is the missing length they don't have this okay so when we have an 
understanding of liquidity distribution once we have that element 
in our trading we don't need charts we don't need candlesticks we don't need 
any of that we just need to have an old reference point in terms of price so 
traders that used this information off floor in other words if they were a 
Floor Trader before uh they would use the excitement 
and and fever of buying and selling around a specific level and they would get a feel for where the order book 
would be as a whole by watching the activity in the pits now when they left 
the pits when everything went to electronic trading there was this major adjustment and a lot of them never 
really could get it they couldn't they couldn't adjust for it I learned tape 
reading while I was a commodity Trader and I would just watch CNBC and uh back 
then it was fnn it was uh you just the same type of uh event where you would 
watch a ticker tape and you would just see this scrolling every 10 minutes you know the 
Futures Market would update and it would tell you where the price is now it doesn't give you the high and the low 
but I would study that literally during the New York session 
for the S&P in the bond market and I would try to get a read on what it was doing by making a notation and I'm not 
saying that you should be doing this I'm just giving you the the evolution if you will of how I internalized how price has 
been delivered because I've always felt that it was to some degree controlled and manipulated but I never understood 
how it could be because we're always told in books the Market's too big to be manipulated and it's not entirely true 
so once we have this liquidity distribution model understood we know specifically the 
protocol for when is a market structure break okay there's so many people that 
have their charts you know lipstick and all marked up like I teach in my free 
tutorials and they'll have the ger the jargon and and the terminology you know 
on on their either commentary or if they're tweeting something or if they're in the YouTube making videos and they say here's a market structure break and 
I if it doesn't fit this criteria then it's not a break in Market structure okay it's not it's not there so there's 
going to be times when we have a market maker cell profile okay and just so you 
know I'm I'm getting a Vibe right now someone's listening and they're thinking okay when you say Market maker cell 
model or cell profile what is that like how do I know that all you're looking for for is a bounce in an existing 
bearish Market that means you're bouncing over here off of something and you don't have to know when it was going 
to bounce in other words I'm not suggesting that I know it's going to create an accumulation here and go up 
retrade back to the accumulation and find support and buy there go higher and create one or two more successive buying 
opportunities to create this turning point I may not see this opportunity until the highest of the reaccumulation 
along side has been broken then it might jump off the chart at me okay because it may be a pair it may be a a stock it may 
be an indic see it may be something someone asked me in an email or send a a tweet about and then immediately my mind 
goes into contrarian mode and I break it down like this so I'm looking for the distribution profile from a liquidity 
standpoint where is the orders and why is the narrative more likely to fail 
them and I'm going to capitalize on that and own trading so when we see things 
like on U like baby Pips or Forex Factory or or something of that effect where we have these very highly 
opinionated folks and they want to share their charts and they show their annotations on the chart I love that I 
love it simply because it gives me a greater read on retail and if we combine 
what I'm you know what I'm showing you here and teaching by the uh liquidity distribution profile once we know this 
and we study the the Market from that perspective it's a GameChanger there's nothing to you know there's nothing else 
to be worrying about we just wait so it removes all the ambiguity about what 
Supply and what's demand Zone okay um it removes all the ambiguity of what 
resistance and support line you should have because these things don't exist there is a specific price point okay 
specific price point and we did this with an Institutional price Model that was taught in 
mentorship and quite honestly I don't recall what month it is in but I'm not 
asking anybody to tweet that either because all it's going to do is just ask uh or Force traders that are in 
mentorship to ask questions this is all Charter Member level so just just keep it that way but the liquidity 
distribution profile that's shown here it looks just like a simple little uh you know the depiction of a graph or 
chart okay or a drawing if you will and this is how I internalized it this is 
the bridge of when I looked at whiteoff okay whiteoff I get accused of oh you're 
teaching woff let me tell you something whiteoff never got this close when you look at wof there you know he talks 
about the markup and the markdown phase okay and cycle that's great and 
initially when I first looked at it it looked like nonsense and it it didn't make any sense to me why because it didn't have chart patterns it didn't 
have a Candlestick chart over top it didn't have open high low and close bar on it it didn't have moving averages on it it didn't have any indicators on it 
it just talked about the market going up and then Market going down and to me it sounded like well obviously it's 
hindsight I mean anybody could talk about it like that and which is what everyone else thinks they see when they 
start looking at my content even folks that go through the free tutorials okay and some of you that went through the 
initial few months it felt like well this is this regurgitated wof stuff and it's not and that's why I encourage 
everyone to go through study it you know I studied it at Great Lengths and depths and while I already understood some 
measure of it because of experience I quickly built upon the the 
the basic premise because it helped me formulate a model for okay when when the 
market is bullish short term but intermediate term it's bearish that's what this liquidity distribution profile 
is showing okay because the Market's here and I anticipate it going lower but 
first it may rally okay so if we have that condition 
this is how we use it so maybe we we've been in a a um a longterm or immediate 
term bare market for a particular um Market or pair and we hit some level 
that is questionable it creates a likelihood of a bounce okay great if 
it's going to bounce we do our PD aray Matrix see where the premium and uh 
discount levels are and where the equilibrium is and we find some measure of premium in here now once we have a 
level of premium in other words how high it can go then we start specifically breaking down the PD arrays from a 
premium standpoint and then we map those out for buy side liquidity in other words something above current price over 
here okay prior to the expected run up to create a selling opportunity remember 
this model is univers veral so it's going to take you several times to watch this in model 6 as well and you probably 
will find it more beneficial next year okay and reason why I'm saying that is 
you'll see more things Having learned it from a theory and conceptual standpoint 
and you'll see it applied like I'm going to show you at the dollar Swiss okay so 
everything that's being shown here is very very deep but it's dry it's very 
very dry content but you will understand the market from a greater depth and 
appreciation for the way liquidity is delivered neutralized and or engineered 
when you understand this whole premise here this is one of there's about five 
or six more things that I won't talk about not even until uh we probably get to 2020 but this is one specific thing 
once you understand this it unlocks when when is the market really showing a market structure break and when is it 
just running stops you have to know what this is showing you okay from the 
narrative side in other words what is price doing why is price doing what it's it doing okay if once you have that it 
removes the whole confusion and it's just simply a matter of waiting and 
that's what you're looking for in you're trading you want to know okay I'm not going to do anything right now because there's nothing to do but how long 
should I wait and when do I know the weight is over and then I can capitalize on the current condition that's what 
this liquidity distribution profile does it provides a framework where I don't 
need a chart I don't trade charts I trade distribution of 
liquidity because the bank is the storefront or the the the storehouse if 
you will they provide the currency or they provide the asset they uh they are 
the underwriter for stocks they are the provider of the liquidity so I just completely skipped 
over the whole what's the chart telling me what's the trend lines and what's the indicators telling me to what is likely 
going on behind the scenes because if I can determine the narrative behind price 
the behaviors are going to be pretty generic going forward and I know with a 
great deal of certainty not complete understanding and Perfection but I have 
a great deal of certainty that I know the probable Behavior going forward in 
that market now if I cannot get a read on price with this element this is the 
first of a few things that I do but if I can't see it from from this perspective or outline a model that would you know 
give me the framework if you will of what price should be doing relative to this then I don't touch the market or I 
sit on my hands and say okay I'm we're just waiting for more insights so underline that okay this is 
the video that you want to come back to next year you because there's a lot of things that will click into place once 
you watch this video a couple times and every two weeks come back to this one 
and then you we'll see more price data we'll see more examples of what I've shown and then also go back and watch in 
December we're not going to be doing a whole lot and half of uh January go back and watch the previous 
weekly videos where I'm talking about okay I'm looking for specific things or I don't have an idea right now what's 
going on and then compare that with what I'm showing you here and it'll make perfect sense you'll know what I didn't 
talk about then because it's it wasn't for you to learn then now you have it so 
we have our liquidity distribution profile this is what we do in terms of viewing price action it's not the Open 
high low and close that's a tool that we use to work within 
this narrative but we have to watch the highest of the 
last reaccumulation of Longs once the liquidity has been taken here other 
words it may been for instance this is the weekly chart uh perspective uh 
Market may be you know rallying off of some bullish order Block in here and we 
we expect it the bounce but we don't really expect the downtrend the end but we run up above a short-term High to run 
the buy stops okay well once those are absorbed the question is how do I know 
if it's going to continue going on or if it's going to break down and then if that breakdown is a market structure 
shift or is it just a run on the cell stops over here think about what I just told you the higher time frame narrative 
is what we're looking for because the institutional order flow on that level is more apt to continue versus something 
we would see for instance on a five or 15 or even 60 Minute basis because those Trends or those uh price runs that we 
see on those lower time frames are very sporadic and very shortterm in nature so 
the large funds are not out there trying to do you know $50 million on a a 
transaction that is going to pan out over a 15minute uh chart that would take up a 
couple hours of the day that's not their model uh you can only move so many millions of dollars okay inside of a 
short fluctuation in price so their expectation on Price is from a higher 
time frame macro standpoint monthly weekly daily and they don't really look at anything less than a daily because 
everything is framed from that daily chart up and that's why like coot reflects all those price behaviors and 
they align and that's why we spend so so much time on the daily chart because without this narrative you're not going 
to be consistent and you're not going to find longevity so once we have this 
understood go back and watch the video again and there's a couple points I've given you in this video to frame out a 
lot of reoccurring questions that come up in the Forum reoccurring questions that come to me by email and or things 
that I see when people think they understand they're still making that same mist mistake of not knowing what 
really makes a market structure break or a shift in Market structure if you will 
so moving on we have the daily chart also once we 
see our weekly chart we're anticipating the same thing to form on the daily chart but the only thing is is now our 
range of opportunity shifts from the daily to a 4H hour and 60 Minute time 
frame and we'll be able to break the market down more or less like a top down approach but what we're doing is 
refining the fractal and I'll show you what that is and what it means when we go into the dollar Swiss chart and 
examples towards the end of the video but here we're focusing on from a daily 
perspective we're expecting this run up to find some distribution and selling 
okay that we're expecting the large fund institution order flow to shift in here 
and start going lower when that highest of the 
long or the highest of the reaccumulation of Longs put that way the reaccumulation over here whichever the 
highest one is Swing Low to the left of the curve once that's broken but we have 
to see the liquidity run first once it's taken there's no more real story line if 
you will to go higher so once we see that on a weekly chart on a daily we're 
expecting that same thing to occur but when now we're refining that fractal and we're saying okay over here we're going 
to look at a 4H hour or a 60-minute time frame and we're going to break that down into really tight uh Precision so we'll 
expect again the sell STS to be ran over here on the left side of the curve and 
then it returns back to fair value fair value is going to be the down closed candles or down close candle on a 4H 
hour or 60-minute time frame once it trades into that candle we will be looking for sell signals okay so it's 
going to go short now from a daily uh standpoint this would be in the form of we expect the price to run down below 
the low on a 4 hour or 60 Minute basis and then we have our power three we can 
now incorporate day trading and shortterm trading using the scalping and 
day trading Concepts you learn mentorship so what does that mean say it's occurs we run down below the the 
sell stops over here on say a Thursday or Friday we wait the weekend we don't care what Sunday's doing and then on 
Monday if we rally back up into the bodies of the down Clos candle or candles over here which is the highest 
of the reaccumulation of Longs before the buy side liquidity is run out 
in other words to make it in layman's terms if we think that there is a level of Buy sell liquidity it's going to be a 
draw on liquidity when price gets to that price point once it's done that 
it's over we're going to wait for evidences that the Market's want to go lower what is that that break below the 
highest of the reaccumulation Longs that occurred prior to that higher time frame 
premium array that we were aiming for to be ran out or in the simplest of terms a 
resistance price point okay now some some level of resistance now retail isn't going to see it that way because 
they're going to be looking for some old low or an old high where it's going to stop dead TRS turn around we've learned that that's not always the case you have 
external range liquidity and internal range liquidity so this whole return back up here could be a return to a 
weekly bearish order block or it could be trading up into a weekly fair value Gap or Clos a liquidity 
void whatever the PD Matrix is allowing you to 
identify during and prior to this whole runup that's what you use everything is going to be slightly different remember 
there is there may not be a fair value Gap there may not be a liquidity void 
but there will be a bearish order block and if there was already a stop run to 
the left over here somewhere if if it comes back up to the uh the bearish order block we know that that's more 
likely to hold versus running a new higher high for higher level buy stops 
okay so just go back and look at month number five content it'll help you kind 
of like dovetail with what what I'm teaching you here so so once that highest level of reaccumulation alongs 
on the left side of the curve is taken out we do have a qualified shift in Market structure again if it trades all the way 
down to the second one okay of the two that would be over here or the first of re accumulation alongs prior to the 
runoff to the smart reversal then we know that there's going to be a larger 
degree of distribution there'll be a larger magnet on liquidity it would take price just not below here but a longer 
term price swing okay and the reason why that occurs this is the theory behind it 
if we go below the first of the reaccumulation alongs here 
and it keeps on going that's not just a simple run on Cell stops that's a heavy measure of distribution and say we go 
down below the first reaccumulation of Longs over here in other words accumulation sideways it 
breaks out of the consolidation comes back down there's your re reation of Longs which is not shown in the chart 
here because I want you to learn the highest of whatever swing lows that form here you want to go to the highest one 
once that's broken on the right side of the curve once that's occured over here then you're anticipating these events 
okay so you're looking for the sell stop run then return to fair value once that occurs then you looking for it to to 
sell off again and it creates an opportunity that if we get this scenario and you miss this one find the next buy 
side over here in other words where the swing low is prior to a run up it's going to match over here that's 
what's missing from wof okay woff very generic theme okay and everyone talks 
about the same way but you never see anyone using woff with this level 
precision and understanding because whiteoff doesn't know things from an 
algorithm standpoint it was too far back in history because of my computer science and information systems training 
when I was learning to be a computer computer programmer and be a systems analyst it's that never happened because 
I never found a job using it that whole experience and I thank God for putting 
me in that direction because even though it didn't pan out that way it gave me great deal of insights about how things 
work from a technological standpoint in other words we create these things um like in 
Lotus 123 if you guys know what that is like a old spreadsheet program kind of like Excel uh we would create these 
things called macros and they're like little short little programs you do this do that do this if it does this you do 
that okay and I thought long and hard about if the markets were going to be 
controlled they would have to have some kind of logic behind it and then 
everything had to be there you know everything had to be as it needs to be 
for it to run efficiently and work correctly syntax has to be correct um there has to be opportunity or data to 
pull from okay and that's why we have the PD arrays because we come back to those same price points just like the 
algorithm will okay so it takes me a great deal of time and effort to take 
folks that have never learned computer programming or thought of things like an algorithmic uh perspective it takes a 
lot more time for folks that have never been exposed to it to learn this folks that are highly technical can readily 
assimilate to what I'm showing and teaching because they've already been exposed to that from higher level maths 
and or some measure of computer programming now today um in high schools 
they offer computer programming and I think it's a wonderful procedure to force if you will 
on to students because it it gives them a framework to look at how everything is 
algorithmic now from advertising to you know efficient uh Staffing of companies 
you know everything is algorithmic and if you don't understand that uh there are many books out there that talk about 
algorithms and things and some of them will probably be very boring for you others will probably be more insightful 
and user friendly but I don't have any of them in my library but I did read 
them in my schooling and for the life of me I can't remember any titles so I know I've open 
up P's box okay what are those books ICT I just don't know I can it's been such a 
long time since the 20s 28 29 years ago it was back in school 
before I even considered being a Trader so just know that these levels of 
understanding are going to take a little bit more work and a lot more to chew on but trust me I didn't learn it the first 
time I was exposed to it and the first time I made notations in my journals it didn't click after a you know one time 
experience so just watching this video in models number six isn't going to click for you so if you're feeling like 
you're still like I can talk about it and you understand what I'm saying that's good that's all you're supposed 
to know right now okay that's all you're supposed to know because when we go to our dollar Swiss chart and you start 
seeing a little bit more of it it'll start becoming more obtainable and 
reachable and over time looking at previous examples of where I say I'm 
waiting for more information this is what I'm waiting for okay all right 
so in this shaded area over here our range of opportunity is from 0.1 to0 2 
but if 0.1 becomes in essence really 02 
because it just completely blows through the first and goes below the second of the reaccumulation alongs over here on 
the left side of the curve if that occurs we have the likelihood of a 
return back to fair value or optimal trade entry and it's going to occur on a 
4H hour or 60-minute chart relative to a daily price swing so this 
whole price swing here is to be viewed and understood conceptually on a daily 
chart but we refine that daily chart to these points of liquidity okay so we 
have the liquidity distribution profile understood that inside this daily price swing we know specifically what we're 
waiting for and what we're looking for that is the highest of the reaccumulation because if that breaks 
down after we've had a run on buy side liquidity that's all that's going to be necessary because then if we see a 
distribution cycle unfold from 0.1 and we trade down to where 0 2 would be we 
have no real reason to force we have to get in here or back here okay a lot of 
folks see that I I I share trades I share analysis and I said okay well you know we're probably going to go up here 
and reverse they assume I'm always selling the tops I'm always buying the bottoms 
I'm not because I'm doing so many things especially nowadays I don't know you know if I'm 
going to be in front of charts at the time because I'm so inundated with correspondents and people coming into to mentorship you know and folks that are 
just just basically asking questions like hey look you know I can't get my account open up all that takes time we 
have thousands of people that we have to manage so it takes a lot out of me so I 
just basically keep myself focused on the lwh hanging fruit and everyone else in the mentorship especially the new people that came in they're like this is 
unbelievable but it's just basically teaching from practical application what I'm 
showing you here over time the graduated experience will provide you the context 
that gives you this Turning Point up here where you can be a buyer down here reaccumulate here reaccumulate here in 
heavy distribution and then wait for the low resist low resistance liquidity run that occurs at smart money 
reversal or the lowrisk short once that occurs you you can't get 
any higher than that with my learning because that's it and mean I'm not saying that there is you know future 
lesson to get to that but we have to get into 2020 before that's even scratched on the surface but this here is the 
framework that you're looking for for waiting for more insights and or if you 
hear me say I'm waiting or I'm sitting on my hands this is exactly what I'm waiting for okay and now you know the 
story line behind it again this is just one more level but we go farther way way 
farther than this because we'll have aspects of time and much more Precision 
in terms of uh what the market will do on a day-by-day basis and a weekly basis 
okay so there's a lot more refinement that we got in terms of lessons ahead and again we won't even get into those 
until like 2020 all right so moving on over so we have cide expansion on a market maker 
buy model so when the market is trading in consolidation we expect it to trade 
down find some measure of sell side liquidity other words it's going to reach for the market liquidity below and 
old low it may trade back down to an old high or it may trade down into a fair value Gap or trade to a bullish order 
block right here is our draw on liquidity in the framework of this model 
but we're inside this fractal and our specific model number seven is only 
focusing on traders that can see just the cell side because I didn't 
understand Short Selling when I first started trading I understood being a buyer because obviously if you buy something cheap and you sell it for more 
money later on you get the difference in in the price and that's great and I didn't understand Short Selling because 
how can you sell something you don't own and buy something back and you made the difference in price 
so just like that or similar to that some of you may not see when to be a 
good buyer okay or when there's buying opportunities but you can see when there's Short Selling that's a normal 
occurrence and vice versa maybe you can't see what's being shown here in model number seven but you could see clearly what's been shown in price 
action model number six all of you are going to have a unique perspective on price and it's 
going to be internalized differently I did not come to this conclusion and understanding all at one 
wave okay it didn't come to me and I was like I woke up and then boom you God laid all this on me in one day we're 
talking about well 26 years now so it was a gradual understanding so give 
yourself the the flexibility and permission to learn this you're not 
going to get it in one video watch okay you're not it's not going to happen like that so people that come in here and get 
to Charter Member and they're watching this and you're just like you're watching it now first uh class Charter 
Member you're looking at this thinking okay this is a lot of dry Theory but 
this is the thing that you're looking for but you don't know because you're looking for something to occur in a 
chart and it's not in the chart it's the narrative what makes the 
narrative from an Institutional standpoint why should be why should we be focusing on the 
liquidity that I talk about in our weekly analysis why why should be focused there and that's what these 
profiles focus on the market maker buy model and the market maker sell model 
are just simple generic templates and in the hands of a a neoy it just looks like 
woff and the reason why it looks like wof is because that's the way price swings occur they start from a low point 
it rallies up to a high and then sells off either fails to go to the initial low or it blows through it and then 
starts to go higher after a stop run or it continues to go even much lower which is continuation those narratives are 
going to be determined from large sample sizes over years of trading so it's 
important to just pick one of these out of the 12 you know price action models we're providing you it's not essential 
you learn all of them because you're not going to do very well trying to apply everything but each time we talk about a 
new one especially six and seven it's going to provide you more understanding 
about the market as a whole and then you will eventually gravitate to one and 
that will be your foundation just like well I had one specific model which 
was being a buyer and I wanted to see a Ty two Trend following with a bullish Divergence in stochastics and that was 
my model and over time I gradually moved into not needing a type two I didn't 
need a type one Divergence I didn't need a stochastic I could see price wanting to go higher and I knew exactly where I 
wanted to be a buyer now again that didn't manifest initially after I 
watched a couple of things you know that I seen in my own study if this was 
something that's going to happen really quick for you I would tell you you know if it ain't happening for you by this time you there's something wrong I'm 
telling you to relax and allow this this is all part of the process and that's 
why most people cannot do this because it requires a great deal of learning experiencing and seeing it not 
work a lot learning from that in the few times that it does work it feels good 
but we're focused on when it doesn't work because where it doesn't work that's where our light bulb movement 
comes in and that's how I got to this information so spending a lot of time in charts trying to figure out what the 
narrative was behind it and then only after it occurred then I could see oh yeah that's what was going on see nobody 
cares about about that you know as you're learning and as you're a Trader no one and that's why most 
people don't want to uh be in the mentorship because they don't care about 
all these things they just want to show me a chart tell me when to buy and sell and that's all I need and that's not what they need you're going to lose your 
money so the folks that are hearing my voice right now in 2018 you're a charter 
member and you've already tried probably trading with live funds and I told you not to do that when you first joined and 
you thought you figured it out cuz you watched a new video or something new came up a new concept or a tweak on something you thought you understood 
from a twe a free tutorial and you now have experienced more pain so I tried to 
spare you that so that way you wouldn't feel toxic and have these uh poor thinking while still learning you're in 
the mentorship still until you know for certain what your model is and you've done six months of 
consistent positive you know response to using that model on paper then 6 months 
in a demo so that means you're a year out even if you finish the you the first core content who cares you know you guys 
are in a hurry to get money and it doesn't work like that but if you are in 
a hurry to be patient that's going to serve you better so we have a liquidity draw below the marketplace and we expect 
it to reach down to this level here now we don't know if it's going to bounce here and create this but the likelihood 
is if we have a consolidation in here we are in a long-term bullish or interterm bull market and we've kind of like 
petered out a little bit and we've shown signs that we're wanting to go lower well how far it's going to go we 
look at a discount array using the PD array Matrix this may be a bullish order block it may be a fair value Gap it may 
be an old high it trades back down to or it may be just below an old low that's 
not being shown in this diagram that may be a run on sell stops whatever those things are because every chart's going 
to be be different relative to the opportunities that's being made available at the time when you're looking at it because there's so many 
possible scenarios I have templates that give you a rough idea on how to engage 
them but you're still going to be limited to what do you see in your chart right now that's why I do these examples 
on Twitter you know what do you see w d Ys they they are to train your 
particular activator system and you what you see in price action over a long long period of time a sample size and 
engaging in you will learn but you can't take 26 years and pour it into a couple 
videos or even 500 videos and expect to just watch it one time and then your ICT doesn't work like that but once we have 
this draw in liquidity we don't care about the right side of the curve all this buy side over 
here that's not what we're looking for we're only looking for opportunities to frame shorting opportunities okay so we 
can see well let's say like this I'm speaking with the perspective in mind 
that the trader that's listening to me that can see these scenarios they're 
comfortable with looking to be a seller here and reaching down to here they don't necessarily know this is going to occur and you don't need to okay and 
that's the benefit of these specific models because once you understand it you just wait for your setups and that's 
what it means to know what you're looking for and wait for it so between the price points in price where we 
notice it and identify the liquidity that the market will seek that is down here okay and the targeted 
liquidity over here this may be a draw later on and that's why we limit it to 
wanting to take our short cover here not looking for a longer term because the likelihood is is we may come down here 
and create a market maker buy profile and then rally up so if we have the market maker buy model occur here 
and it rallies up if we we've taken our profits here this can't hurt us on any short positions but then again we don't 
know for certain that this is going to create that buying opportunity and that's how we trade in the gray area we 
do not trade with specific this is the way it's going to be panaceas okay be 
and Dolls don't exist we have framework we have structure we have things that we look for and if they materialize then we 
engage but if they don't materialize we wait for more information and if they completely 
unravel then you know it's over so in this case what would be those scenarios 
if we are looking for an area in here where this is our range of opportunity 
and you have 0.1 and then we have 0 2 down here these are our two selling 
opportunities okay look to go short if we expect it to go short and say we sell short here and we we get stopped out and 
continues to run and goes back above these equal highs that means we don't see a market maker buy model here at all 
because it shouldn't do that until it creates a longer term rundown here creates the the curve then starts 
building on the side of the buy side once you determine on what you're 
going to focusing on on your beginning or your foundational price action model whichever you feel comfortable with and 
I had an email from one of our chart members uh he states that you know the up until now the price action models 
have been useless to him and he just looks for XYZ and there it is and that's 
fine that's a normal thing I I I wasn't offended by that and he's not the only one that sent that to 
me the models that we talk about are just there 
for foundational purposes cuz some people they have all this content now but what am I supposed to do with it you 
don't need to have everything at your disposal but over time you're going to learn when you can apply certain things 
and when you're going to feel comfortable using in your model you don't have to have every facet 
of the mentorship and that's the whole point of these models because none of 
them are exactly the same but all of them will get you to a price point understanding where you can carve out 
setups every single week and sometimes daily which is exactly what I'm showing you here Point uh price action model 
number six number seven are Universal so if you understand this information as we show on uh dollar Swiss in a little bit 
you'll see that it's absolutely 100% what you don't know but always been 
there even through the the core content using the 
information and then showing you beforehand and then now I can go back to say this is exactly what we've talked 
about in theory from a modular standpoint now it's been applied and this is how you use it and put it into a 
price action model so you can start practicing with it and looking for opportunities and knowing that these are 
are your models or your model and you don't deviate from it because you're not 
going to learn anything by well I'm going to do a little bit of price action model number two and I like model model 
number one I'll do number seven today or I'll do it for this month don't do that whatever one you feel strongly 
about or you know makes you feel like oh it makes sense that's the one you go to 
and you start there all of you are going to have different levels of understanding some of you are much more 
advanced in my content some of you are still in the ropes about you know what you're supposed to do it's not a lot of 
you like that but there are some and In fairness and in disclosure you know we've been now a full year after the 
mentorship core content and I have a couple of you that just feel like you're waffling don't know really what you're 
doing and and that's okay don't don't let it you know beat you down but you 
have to know that that's normal for some and don't feel like you're you know left less intelligent or that you're never 
going to get this it just means that you got to take a little bit more time and your your price action model suggestion 
may not have been shown yet you know this is only seven I got what five more to go 
so with that said this is our range of opportunities so we're going to be looking for our liquidity distribution 
profile to give us more insights so we have that here so we're expecting price to go down 
that's all we need to know do we know that it's going to uh reach the sell side liquidity pull down here at a 
discount some PD array and bounce no we don't need to know that okay there's 
some of you that feel like you got to know five trades in advance you don't need to do that all you need to know is 
what's the opportunity right now if there is none you wait okay simple as that you don't start adding 15 different 
markets or asset classes or pairs to your Your Arsenal just so you can find 
something you pick one or two markets or a pair and you focus there and you wait for 
your specific setups that's how you refine yourself as a Trader an analyst is improved when they're only being 
exposed to one or two things it's going to be easy for someone to have an opinion about 30 different 
markets all one time and some of them are going to be right some of them aren't and what's going to happen is is 
you or anyone else watching you or that you made your opinions public they're going to start doing ratios on how 
you know your percentage of accuracy on this and that and assume right away that you're either not as good as you say you 
are or thought you were and they're going to tell you all about it and what's that going to do it's going to be demoralizing for you so your opinions 
and things that you expect are meant to go in your study Journal not on social 
media because it's not going to be received like you want it to I'm ICT and there many times I put things on the 
internet they become you know the gospel later on months down the road Road years 
later on I mean look at bit Bitcoin for instance you know I was getting laughed off the internet by crypto Twitter and 
who's laughing now so the point is you're never going to be received well doing that because there's going to be 
uh a contrary opinion and many times I've already admitted that I'm always contrarian to whoever even if it's a 
mentorship student if if they start putting a chart out there immediately I'm going in there with a contrary 
perspective it doesn't mean I'm going in there taking a trade immediately on the basis of being contrary it just means 
that that's my nature if you tell me don't walk on the grass I'm tap dancing on it 
just it's just the way it is that's me so if we understand that the Market's 
going lower that's all that's necessary we don't need to know that it's going to bounce here that's not necessary for you 
to know that I don't always know that no one has that ability no one has that you 
might have it once in a while where you have a a rhythm where you can get a good feel for it and I think you've seen me 
do that this past year once once or twice but there's a couple times where you saw me wait for more information and 
I'm waiting for and sometimes I waited and it moved without me and that's fine it's not hurting anyone it's not going 
to hurt you it's not going to make you any less of a Trader or an analyst none of that stuff's going to be detrimental 
to your longevity it's going to increase it it's going to build it up 
so from a theory standpoint we're looking for the market to trade lower 
that's all that's necessary now if we are bearish this just basically what we're doing here we're essentially 
adopting the bare mindset how are we going to go short so we're looking for levels of redistribution so words we're 
looking for a level of accumulation of shorts It's Consolidated maybe it's Consolidated and ran up and run some 
stops or maybe it's just broke down because of relative analysis relative strength analysis suggesting that it 
shouldn't go higher so therefore for a Juda swing on a high time frame shouldn't be expected because of a 
correlated pair Maybe maybe it it's already done that and say for instance this is the the cable and the the euro 
dollar maybe went higher on this time frame ran stops and went lower but because of sympathy okay the cable's 
going to move lower and not post that higher high running an old high out and 
running stops because then we'll have correlated smt distribution shown from smt standpoint EUR dollar making a 
higher high c not making a higher high okay so whatever that is that forms the 
basis of your accumulation of short positions once that breaks down we look for return back to that consolidation 
that's 0.1 it may not be a 0.1 return back to the consolidation it may go lower and 
then come back and trade into another PD array okay it may create a fair value 
Gap that it trades up into on the swing away from that original consolidation then we have an expectation that it's 
going to trade off go lower same scenario here we're looking for a measure of 
redistribution on the right side of the curve in price action model number six we knew that we're looking for fair 
value gaps and sell stops to form sell stops and fair value gaps but that's going to 
be looking through the curve which is the midpoint of this overall decline to 
create a buying opportunity for a price action model standpoint again focusing on on the short short side only because 
this model is for you short sellers only or if the condition is we're bearish 
this is how you operate in that model or that market profile we look for 
areas of distribution in here so we seek the liquidity trading down going lower 
and once we get to this price point we have majority if not all of our positions 
covered because we don't know if it's going to create this bounce and we don't know know if it's going to just 
consolidate and go sideways or it can continuously go lower either case taking 
profits here is logical and it's something you should be 
doing so inside this shaded area this is our range of opportunity accumulation 
0.1 redistribution 2 redistribution down to a cell side liquidity pool for offset 
distribution offsetting what the short positions that were accumulated here and re accumulating long positions 
for a immedate term or long-term continuation to the upside all right so with all that we're 
going to go back to our example that we're referring to for Price action model number six that took a great deal 
of time okay as convenient as it was to keep you guys waiting uh the profile 
shown on the dollar Swiss is what we were following if you remember back on Twitter I tweeted in here you know watch 
these equal lows in here everything was framed on what I'm about to teach you and show you in price action for dollar 
Swiss but we had equal highs in here and we also had equal highs in here so there's a draw on liquidity from a 
long-term perspective here IM term perspective here and a short-term perspective here and now I'm going to go 
into the actual price chart and break all this down using what has been shown here to give you greater insights and 
understanding all right so we're looking at the dollar Swiss this is a weekly chart and I'm going to get right into it 
so you probably have to watch this video again multiple times to get the benefit 
of everything I've jammed into it but right away we 
have several things that should jump off the chart of you now obviously I have the benefit of hindsight working for me 
here but you also have to refer back to my Twitter and from any other previous 
commentary that mentioned about this pair we have equal highs in here this is a weekly chart so it's been several 
weeks since we moved from this low here on the weekly chart there is two 
Market maker models the weekly Market maker buy model 
and continuation is seen here we 
have consolidation drop down to a level of 
sell side liquidity then a rally up and continuation on the upside we have a 
market maker sell model which is the consolidation scene here and I'll map this out for you real 
quick so we have a consolidation in 
here usually I do this in green but I'm just going to do it as just a real quick 
shading and then we have our other consolidation up 
here okay and above this consolidation we have 
that liquidity pool in form of buy stops and here's our consolidation here it leaves consolidation comes back this is 
our reaccumulation rallies on up runs out the buy stop Above This High 
here here creates equal highs and then we enter a measure of distribution other 
words selling we're going to see a sell off but it trades back down to what this 
specific candle right here so I'm going to take this box off I just want to show 
you the two price points that create the consolidation in the framework but I'm 
going to show you so we have our order block 
here and it's just going to have to do for now the open on this is 
9547 so keep that number in mind so 9547 when Market was trading softer here 
all during this period here we're expecting the dollar to be bearish go back and look at our commentary okay so 
all of this all the way down into October we expected weakness on the dollar the payer's name starts with the 
dollar so if we're bearish dollar stands a reason that this pair should drop down okay in sympathy with the weaker dollar 
then we entered a period of time where seasonally the dollar Index should be bullish that actually occurred the time 
period Well if you look at the uh the low here we have September 16th and then 
on this candle right here it rallied off at the last week of September okay but 
it reacted off the a block so it's a little ahead of the seasonal tendency but it is what it is um the seasonal 
tendency for the dollar Index um being bullish transitions from September and 
October go look at your uh seasonal tendencies that were shown in the mentorship so we have Market maker sell 
profile here and then the sell off goes right back down into an area of 
what reaccumulation so when we know these price points as I talked about price 
action model number six and seven these points are going to be sensitive okay and if we see it come 
back to that level here we have to assume there's going to be some measure of Bounce likely now that bounce the 
story line now has it can bounce why where is it going to bounce up to well it can close in this inefficiency on the 
cell side and or run these equal highs bullish scenario for seasonal 
tendency for the dollar Index we trade it down to a bullish order block and we look at all the highs up 
here they're still clean okay so we have all that going for 
us in terms of framework so the bullish order block at 9547 can be calibrated to 
9550 or 9540 so we're going to elect to go with 
since the open is what we have a open of 9547 so we can do 9545 and we can do 
9540 so we're going to do 9540 calibrating to a zero level and we'll go down into a daily 
chart and provide more 
insights all right and that's that so now what we're going to do we're 
going drop into a daily chart so we have our draw Zone liquidity we can go down to the order block here when it's 
dropping down and we have the buy side liquidity pool 
in the form of buy stops about these equal highs and we've given the context of the 
fractals that's available at the time eventually you you'll see it when it's 
here it could trade down from there and hit the order block that's our 
discount array here at a time when bullishness is expected coming into the dollar Index so we expected to run up 
and hit these equal highs now if we're trading down here and we expect it to go 
up to here is that a day trade is it a scalp is it a shortterm 
one shot one kill sure absolutely and longer term we have these over 
here so we could do a a lot of different forms of trading but universally 
speaking uh it's applicable to all of them focusing on the buy side only once we get to here okay so not focusing on 
um shorting during this period here and up until these e equal Highs are taken out 
just makes the probabilities higher now it doesn't mean you can't find shorts 
obviously you can scalp and do one day trade you know here and there going short but just it goes against 
institutional orderflow which is why I always say why are you doing that okay there's a lot of people I know Chris 
Lori he promotes the idea of you not having a bias and you know he props this 
the in his his groups that you know it's you have to convince me of this and you have to 
convince me of that and with all due respect um I don't really have to convince anyone I I just know that this 
is what usually takes place and the volatility and expansion and magnitude 
is going to go in the direction of institutional orderflow so if I'm trading against institutional orderflow my expectations are going to be rather 
Limited in terms of contrarily speaking if we were we're 
trading with institution overflow we know that there should be speed there should be magnitude there should be a great deal of volatility in that 
direction working for us not against this okay it's like that salmon analogy 
I gave in the free tutorials you almost eight years ago you know the salon's a 
strong swimmer it can swim upstream but when it gets to the top of the stream it's dead you it does its business when 
it gets up there but it's dead I don't want to swim against the current so in my teachings I want you all to have that 
same mindset you don't want to be trading against the grein or trading against the overall tide of the delivery 
of price if the price is predisposed to go higher why on Earth would you want to go short the probabilities are higher 
stacked in your favor when you're trading you know with institutional overflow so with that said we're going 
to drw down into a 
daily okay we'll zoom in a little bit here and get a little bit more context so we have our weekly order block here 
from our weekly standpoint using price action model number s's conceptual 
Theory with this in mind it's price reaching down into this level here this 
is our order block okay so we're looking for 9540 we need to 
justify and convince ourselves further with the narrative that it's going to go down to this level but let's refine that 
a little bit more better than just that if we go into this area R in here notice that we had relative equal highs okay we 
had relative equal highs here and price did run above it didn't reject and go lower okay it continued higher when I 
see that what I'm looking for is a rejection 
block okay so if this is a a base of 
overall order flow where we saw resistance then it found support and then it found support again okay they 
have clearly outlined 9545 as a specific price 
point we see that in the form of that Weekly order block so it further sells 
the narrative to us as an analyst that this is very influential in terms of price action so if that's the case and 
we do at a later time trade down to it I want to be focusing on the rejection block because that's going to be the 
discount rate that's going to be important to me um we do have wicks in 
here okay but in here we're going look at this candle and the lowest close is 
9542 okay this down closed candle that's what we're looking for for rejection 
block the down closed candle the closing price is 
9542 9542 and we're up here okay we're up in this area here we expect the price 
to trade down to the rejection block the expectation is it should trade to it 
and through it but we only need it to trade to it that's the rejection block so price 
should come down into that price level and we're going to calibrate it from 
9540 to 9542 just so we have our rejection block 
on the chart okay and we have these equal lows it could be 
reaching for liquidity have a fair value Gap in here as well we have another equal low liquidity pool resting there 
as well so all those are probable scenarios but I'm looking for the lwh 
hanging fruit folks low hanging fruit is this rejection block now one could argue and say well the low hanging fruit is 
rap low here in the form of sell stop liquidity pool I I would agree to some degree but 
we're close in terms of proximity with these equal lows if it's going to go here it's probably going to go to the 
rejection block and and maybe even go for the fair value Gap so I elect to use the fair value Gap and that's what I had 
in mind I was giving you guys the jaw owning on Twitter about it all right so price breaks down we 
have a consolidation in here let me zoom out and now we've done our business with that all right so we have 
our draw a trend line here segment just to delineate the 
range so here's our trading range here and our liquidity pool resting up here in the form of buy stops take that off 
just for completeness and uh Clarity so here's our consolidation the market 
trades away from equilibrium the high and the low seen here sells off comes 
back with this right in here what is that that is our first level of 
redistribution so there's distribution here there's distribution back here obviously but this is where the market 
leaves the consolidation comes back this is 0.1 of redistribution so that's our 
first selling opportunity trade down to this level this is where we're looking for that 
rejection block so that's our objective just so happens to be that's actually the low here 9542 interesting enough so 
right away we can start looking for our grading of price swing so we have 
this high back here that's the top of our range and we're going to draw it all the way down to the ection 
block okay for range 
purposes so we have in this Essence we have this price swing in close 
proximity we have a level in here where we saw selling in here we open trade it 
back up to it and form of a Judas swing again these are daily candles in in here 
we had a measure of distribution in here as well so real nice distribution we get to that 
level taking it to the point at which it leaves the consolidation which 
is this level here to here again grading the price 
swings we have price getting close proximity to this 
level we have it here with this one and there's a lot of consolidation in here so we don't really get that and much 
like I taught in the mentorship when we get to the third grade of the price Lan before get to the objective or Terminus 
uh the origin is here level one level two level three 
many times will not create an opportunity because it's just going to be in a hurry to get down to 
terminus right so we have 
that point one distribution point two 
redistribution in here it comes really deep in here and it sells off again I 
gave multiple scenarios on how we could look at these price swings in here on a 
4 hour and a 1 hour basis each one of these was a market maker sell model 
consolidation rally up distribution sells off makes a lower low consolidation rallies up runs higher 
bodies not quick okay distribution lower low okay here's another one 
consolidation rally up distribution lower low into Terminus okay and I'll 
show you what that looks like when we get in lower time frames and we'll do that now we're focusing on this is our range 
of opportunity again using the price action model number seven criteria this is all 
we're looking for that's the range okay how are we going to operate in that up closed candle into the 
consolidation that is our initial distribution cycle 
where we're going to see the first measure of or expect to see rather selling off if we continue to see rally 
up then that completely negates this whole profile and we have to put it on the back burner and we wait if we took a trade we took a we took a loss as simple 
as that but if we say see a sell off then we know that we can go back in and 
look for the levels of liquidity to sell at and what does 
that mean well keep going on over here keep keep looking over here what do you 
have right there what is this from this candle's high at 
9724 and this candle's low 
9747 okay 
watch we had sell side offered right 
there and the buy side imbalance starts right 
there so right between these two price points there's only buy side offer we're 
expecting price to go lower we see the sell side delivered here so once this closes this point right there this 
range from high and low delineated by 9747 
9723 that becomes a balanced price range what does that mean that means that it 
should act like a natural support or resistance because the balance of buy side and sell side has been offered 
notice that it's happening when we're expecting it to trade down to here lower prices during seasonal tendency for the 
dollar to be weaker and we have our PD arays 
outlined look at the buy at the candles yes it Wicks through here a little bit by here and a little bit in here but look at the bulk of the volume 
delineated by the bodies of the candles heavy distribution in here heavy distribution in here and then trades 
down to terminus okay we're going to have this Insight on our 4our chart 
we'll drop down into 4 hour 
now okay so now we have our price range defined here we're going to look at this range 
from the first level of redistribution down to terminus because Terminus is already predetermined that's 
not after the fact it's a determined price level before it even trades there 
okay so you can see the the delivery of price right after it trades into that 
balanced price range cut left you see this up close 
candle they bought in here whatever they bought in here that has to be mitigated that's a mitigation block 
right there why it's trading back up into after trading into a balanced price range in a seasonal tendency in an 
existing price Model the market maker 
buy model if consolidation we're trading down how far it's going to trade down Michael I'm showing you everything 
that's shown here is conceptually shown in the mentorship and what I've shown you in the theory portion of model 
number seven other words the first half of this video the distribution cycle that occurs in 
here and in here inside these two price ranges that's a balanced price range 
this is a 4H hour chart what do you see before I do any further you know Revelation to you what 
do you see in the chart optimal trade entry optimal trade 
entry we have equal lows price is going to want to distribute and go lower every 
time we create a new low we do 10 20 30 pip grades but below it to get our Targets on how far our price is going to 
reach till we get to terminus okay so let's go back into price through a an 
hourly 
chart okay there's our balanced price range price breaks 
down rallies back up sells off 
rallies back up hits that balanced price range again sells off what's it targeting the liquidity below the low 
here so now we have a liquidity pool resting below here even though we have this deep rally up what's actually 
happening we have a market maker buy model have 
consolidation okay this whole consolidation this low to the high that's that's the range okay price 
trades back up into it here that's your return for consolidation distribution 
should kick in it does okay then it rallies back up into this level one here it's up closed candle redistribution 
sells off what's it targeting the lows okay so the Market's going to seek liquidity below for a low resistance 
liquidity run price has a rally all the way up this is not in our model maybe we 
took something in here as a sell maybe got wiped out got stopped no problem it returns back to that balanced price 
range price breaks down again so what do we see here we have 
consolidation reaccumulation reaccumulation three times see that so 
this is the highest one when price breaks down below that there's our Market structure shift price rallies up 
this is our lowrisk entry sells 
off R in here this is the next cell why because it's focused on this side of the 
curve It reversed here here so go left all up I'm sorry all down Clos candles 
is what we're focusing on in swing lows there's our price point to match up our 
liquidity so it's right over here smaller short-term optimal trade entry 
if we go into a 15in time frame sells off into what bullish candle 
prior down move what is this bear order block opal trade entry at the point of 
our liquidity distribution profile think about what I showed you this is where 
they should sell off because they bought long here they want to mitigate here then we'll have a what a low resistance 
liquidity run to attack the sell stops below this low it runs aggressively for 
it okay we have a market maker buy model 
consolidation trades down distribution sell off R 
distribution sell off what's it reach for liquidity below here now we consolidate it rallies again it goes 
above comes back down retraces into what this up closed candle was where they 
sold before they get to mitigate it right here rally up again to what to run above these sell stops all of this is 
price action model number six but dovetailing with price action model number seven because now we have an 
imbalance in here sside delivery trades back up and that is our discount and 
premium arrays working together now this this a premium array it sells off what's it going to attack the liquidity resting 
below here selling short optimal trade entry if you want to look for this the pattern like that okay we have a fair 
value Gap here runs lower ultimately trying to reach for that 9542 rejection 
block or lower so price makes a run below this low here and then creates 
what consolidation rally return to consolidation rally again what's it run 
out the previous High so now we can look for what distribution 
Cycles Market breaks down this is the only one we have for our shift in Market structure to break it doesn't happen 
till here so what does that mean the next one is the consolidation so if it's this one if we get a sell off in here 
it's going to be much more pronounced not just a shallow run below the lows and look what it does runs all the way 
down to terminus okay so there's a lot of doveet tailing of all the things that you learn 
mentorship it's being shown here but on the cell side of an existing bullish 
scenario all of this shown inside of 
this portion of price action this is the usable part of the fractal using the 
concepts and the liquidity distribution profile that I shot I showed you in model number six and model number 7 here 
if I go back out to a daily chart 
okay and we zoom in 
on this shortterm low here the low comes in at 
9578 essentially is basically uh 
9575 okay so 9575 because if we're up here and we're 
trading down to this low if we're expecting that low to be taken out it's 
reasonable to expect 9575 will be traded to right because we're looking for five levels and zero levels so if we're 
calibrating to 9575 10 Pips below that would be 9565 then 20 Pips would be 
95 55 and then 30 Pips would be what 
9545 so even if we don't use a rejection block and we calibrate to again low 
hanging fruit looking for the the easy objectives and targets and only working 
with that not trying to be Mr precise don't try to be an ICT 
clone below this low we have a 30 pip grade swing potential to 
9545 and again it only went it only went three Pips below that to 9542 but we 
already had 9540 calibrated from a weekly order block once this is arrived at once we 
understand that we have a context to work within using the narrative that the price is providing us now obviously 
watching this it it it it I it feels like an oversimplification and believe me I appreciate that and I know the 
gravity of what I'm saying it seems like it's you know an oversimplification but 
I'm also taking in account that you have gone through all of the core content and you've watched me use these things and 
I'm telling you how I do it everything that I teach in the mentorship is being 
applied here the in balance that's shown right in 
here okay right in here I'm going to show you that one as well zoom in we have this candle's 
high right there at 
9762 remember everything has to rebalance that's the whole point of what 
the markets are doing all the time it's not anything other than that it's all liquidity 
based so on a daily chart this candle's low here is 
9768 okay so we're talking about six Pips in in 
separation and we'll leave this one here as the overall balance so a rebalancing 
on the buy side here we have a a fair value Gap here and we have a fair value Gap that was outlined from this low 
right here we'll just leave it as it is and look at the delivery of price 
the high is exactly 9767 one pip away from our predetermined 
fair value Gap again over here what what are we using you got to cut through all 
this and determine where the imbalance is that's what the algorithm does that's 
all if this function is is the rebalance and or engineer it's simple it's simple 
as that now what makes it hard is determining what is going on at the time in the market and fitting a narrative to 
what you see in price and the possible scenarios that could unfold relative to 
a bias and what's the bias based on a weekly chart because that's where the large funds are building their their 
bias and using a daily chart for entry and it's that's the whole thing in a nutshell once we understand that and we 
take a step back then we can see oh wow look at this you know we entered a period of September October bullishness for the dollar it hit a weekly bullish 
order block it completed a market maker uh buy model and now we have these equal highs up 
here so we should see what price should reach up and it does hits it the market maker buy 
model completes right here with this and then not surprisingly we see the market 
sell off so hopefully you've learned something from model number six and 
model number seven uh that really is like the core underpinnings to what I do on my 
weekly analys is I mean I don't really do anything more than just what I just taught thus now if I stop and don't do 
any more price action models and I never teach anymore you know everything that I 
use in my weekly analysis that's it I don't teach anything beyond that because it's easy 
for me to operate on a week-by-week basis using what I just taught so 
everything from the today's video going backwards everything 
I've ever taught you know now everything I use to make my weekly analysis 
commentary and you seen how consistent it is and if that's all you aim for or 
just three4 of that okay you're going to do very very very well you don't need a 
whole lot to do very well in this business but you do need a model and you need to have a context to work within 
and I've provided that with you now so next time I wish you good luck and good 
treating
