# ICT Charter Price Action Model 12 - Scalping Intraday Model

*Extracted from: ICT Charter Price Action Model 12 - Scalping Intraday Model.docx*

---

okay folks welcome 
back this is the ICT mentorship price 
action model number 12 it's a scalping 
model and its focus is 20 Pips per 
trade okay see I price action model 
number 12 a scalping model 20 Pips per 
trade the stage used for this model is a 
daily range 
expansion order blocks and fair value 
Gap is the setup internal range to 20 
pip price runs is the 
pattern all right so the daily range 
expansion what we're going to be 
focusing on is the identification of the 
likely or most probable direction of the 
current daily bar or 
candle we're going to be focusing on 
order blocks coupled with a fair value 
Gap now right away You're already 
thinking oh I've heard this before 
Michael 
no we're going to be waiting for an 
order block to form then an expansion 
swing to unfold so what we're doing is 
is we're waiting for that order 
block to facilitate a expansion swing so 
while we qualify valid order blocks or 
high probability order blocks with fair 
value gaps sometimes an order block will 
form a down closed candle near a 
an important key level from a higher 
time frame level and that down closed 
candle may not necessarily have a fair 
value Gap so we're filtering that with 
any down closed candle that was at the 
beginning of a initial expansion price 
swing then it has to be retested okay 
that order block gets traded down into 
then after that takes place the 
expansion swing that unfolds after the 
retest of the order block 
we are then looking for the fair value 
Gap and again internal range liquidity 
we're going to us alizing that in the 
form of internal range liquidity pools 
to facilitate an entry in the direction 
of a simple 20 pip price 
run now right away your mind's probably 
thinking okay all you're doing is 
talking about the same thing you've 
already talked about in recent 
months before I get into it I want you 
to understand certain things here 
I've taught you how to qualify in my 
definition a high probability order 
block they are coupled with a fair value 
Gap linked directly to the 
candle this model is not suggesting that 
at all what we're doing is showing you 
how to find fair value gaps in the 
middle of price runs that are not 
directly related to or close to 
necessarily a order block the question 
is is what Gap do I use I'm getting that 
question all the time and I promised 
everybody would come to you if you just 
waited okay there's a lot of other 
things we're going to build on but this 
is one simple measure now it right away 
your mind should be 
turning this isn't limited to a scalping 
model while I am presenting it in a 
scalper's 
presentation it's not limited to that 
it's not certainly at all limited to 20 
Pips if you scale this up to larger time 
frames the model will deliver larger pip 
huls okay or the profit margins will 
increase in terms of Pips relative to 
the time frame you're looking at 
it okay so our first example here in 
this very very brief model because there 
is really not a lot to talk about 
because everything I'm going to say here 
you've already learned in the core 
content so this is the euro dollar okay 
and the model is built on for scalping 5 
minute charts okay okay so we're looking 
for a directional bias I've already 
taught you how to do that uh when the 
bias is bullish in this case for the 
euro dollar we could see a bullish order 
block here now notice this down close 
candle right before this big move here 
there's really an absence of any fair 
value Gap now does that make that a low 
probability order block well in terms of 
my definition yes now will I be wrong 
yes and that's okay why am I okay with 
being wrong because I know this model 
will give me the entry patterns that I'm 
looking for that won't give me the fair 
value Gap in an Ideal World we want to 
see this down closed candle create some 
kind of a gap here there isn't one 
because this comes down closes any 
likelihood of a gap so this one here 
won't necessarily have my attention 
right away what would I be waiting for 
this model Watch What Happens the price 
comes back down slams into the order 
block this down closed candle the last 
upper portion okay in other words the 
highest portion of the candle or the 
high to the midpoint or mean threshold 
is what I'm highlighting here now in 
full order block Theory we would use the 
entire candle but I like to use the 
upper portion because that's where the 
most sensitivity is going to be so price 
trades down into it even at this moment 
here I don't have to be a buyer in fact 
I don't want to be a buyer there with 
this model what am I waiting for I'm 
waiting for the order block to prove 
there is expansion okay so there's an 
expansion swing here taking price higher 
inside this price swing there's a fair 
value 
Gap right 
here one single pass through one candle 
previous candle's High next candle's low 
there's your fair value Gap this 
candle's low is what we frame the fair 
value gaps 
high so all it needs to do is trade to 
this price or lower and we could add the 
spread and we can be a buyer 
there this is what happens here this is 
the order 
block fair value Gap coupled for this 
model notice the distinction 
here this down closed 
candle can't be referred to an order 
Block in the that what I taught as a 
high probability down closed candle with 
a fair value Gap above it okay that 
would be the ideal high probability 
order block this order block or down 
closed candle has the Gap inside of the 
candle see difference okay so the 
distinction is we want to see price show 
un willingness to want to 
Rally why is this pattern powerful why 
is it even being mentioned why does it 
have its own mod model the reason is 
this smart money bought down here I may 
have missed that you're going to miss it 
okay price comes back down into it I may 
not still see it here but if I see price 
react and it creates expansion move here 
I can see that the narrative is okay 
they bought here off the order block 
they did a huge accumulation of orders 
here this one I may have missed this one 
I won't miss 
the expansion move I go inside of this 
range here and find where's the fair 
value Gap well there it is which Gap do 
I buy that one using model number 12 
this is what you're looking for Price 
drops down into the fair value Gap here 
we know that there's a displacement here 
and there's a displacement here they 
have kept price in a relatively small 
range small ranges bring what large 
ranges as a scalper intraday you want 
volatility you want directional impulse 
this is what you're looking for coupling 
both order block expansion swing then 
fair value Gap 
formation by the top of the gap or in 
this case the low of this candle 
here you have a little bit of draw down 
not much at all I mean very very very 
modest very modest draw down we're 
talking like one or two Pips okay if if 
you're adding that minus the spread M 
you 
obviously price runs the Shaded area is 
20 Pips now this uh price point if you 
look at it it actually went higher in 
the day the only thing I'm showing is a 
20 pip run for illustrative 
purposes look at another example here 
after buying that low you can see very 
very nice handsome price 
action another euro dollar you see price 
comes 
down that last down closed candle no 
fair value Gap to to speak of in here 
price creates a impulse swing I may miss 
it I may second guess this I don't know 
what's going on it's got double bottom 
formation here we know there's a 
likelihood of what a potential stop run 
so I'm not having this really on my 
radar yet but Watch What Happens price 
drops down into the order block and then 
we have expansion okay so we have the 
expansion swing in here my IE goes 
inside this range and I want to see 
where's the fair value 
G there's the fair value 
Gap and yes in this sense we do have the 
high probability order block with the 
down closed candle with a fair value Gap 
so right away you know this is the 
likelihood of a potential bullish order 
block but if you would use that theory 
would you have gotten filed on this it 
never got down there but Model 12 gives 
you the entry 
pattern fair value Gap 
here there's your 
entry at this 
candles low or just below it plus 
spread beautiful 20 pip expansion and 
well beyond and I left this over here 
just for uh context relative equal highs 
and you can you can incorporate other 
models take profits that you know to use 
for additional p u pip objectives don't 
limit it to so many Pips so obviously if 
you can get 20 Pips bank that take 80% 
off and then look for other models to 
over that with Target Theory so wherever 
price may lead to relative to what 
you've learned in other models in the 
core content look for those as 
additional runs for liquidity but this 
model specifically is dealing with 20 
pit runs you're not trying to get the 
absolute low you're not trying to get 
the absolute High all you want is bread 
and butter give me 20 Pips thank you 
very 
much next example here is the guppy 
which is pound 
y up Clos candles here all one order 
block price trades down comes right back 
up into the order block and then we have 
the proof in the price swing we have an 
expansion price swing 
lower so my eye looks inside this range 
here where's the fair value got this one 
down here is too low it's it's not 
enough for me to want to chase that cuz 
we're too far 
extended last two up Clos candles in 
here they made more want to make a run 
up into these up closed candles in the 
form of bearish order block so I would 
never want to look for like this here as 
a fair value Gap I would want to look 
for this price High down to the low 
think in terms of your PD array 
Matrix the high to this low split it in 
half it has to go above or at the 50% 
level to get to a equilibrium or premium 
level that would be filtered for this 
right here the fair value Gap is 
here so fair value Gap and this candle's 
high or just above it would be your fill 
right in here and the Shaded area 
constitutes a 20 pip 
run factoring spread and slippage or 
whatever the point is is all you're 
looking for is that 20 pip bread and 
butter 
setup bearish order 
block hits it expansion price s 
we're looking for the fair value Gap 
then that's the protocol so we're not 
forcing uh a perception of okay I want 
to look for every potential fair value 
Gap and I'm going to trade it no you do 
not want to do that and if you've tried 
doing it recently since you've learned 
about fair value gaps you've probably 
encountered that 
conundrum so some of the algorithmic 
theory that we'll cover in 2020 are 
things like this where certain things 
have to happen in a series of or 
specific order then an outcome should be 
reasonably expected okay so it helps you 
have more prognostication it gives you 
perception it gives you depth of 
understanding about what you're seeing 
in terms of price action at the moment 
and not just guessing because there is a 
a logical theory behind why and where 
price reacts And Trades 
from this actually has another example 
here that I didn't have but as I'm 
talking to you I'm looking at it right 
now I went right to it we have the last 
two up Clos candles here price trades 
down away and comes right back up into 
the bearish order block then we have 
what then we have a an expansion 
swing fair value got right there there's 
your 
fill think above this range here the 
Shaded area 20 Pips from here to here 
there's 20 Pips okay it's right there I 
didn't include it because I wasn't 
looking for that one in the same day but 
the same day it gives it to you again 
same pattern same 
concept you look at an order block or 
you can wait and catch it after in other 
words you're not always going to need to 
anticipate these setups many times 
you're going to catch it after it does 
this where it starts to run this is the 
reason why I say we don't chase price we 
do not do it because there's going to a 
procedure that will allow you to get 
into the marketplace at a fair value 
hence fair value Gap and that's what's 
happening here 
now how far into the fair value Gap it 
goes is going to be dependent on your 
broker and that's the reason why this 
pattern is set to trading at the low of 
the fair value gap for 
shorts and at the high for 
Longs okay because every spread is going 
to be different every broker going to be 
slightly different some Brokers may come 
all the way up and fill in this Gap some 
of them may go up to consequent 
encroachment some may just tap where the 
Gap is well in this case a fair value 
Gap that's bearish it would be the low 
the Gap that's what you're looking for 
for your 
entry that may be all it does and it 
never fills that Gap so that's the 
reason why I create these models in in 
the way I I have because it's meant for 
you to get a fill with your demo so that 
way you can build experience and not 
miss a lot of the price swings whenever 
we're trading fair value gaps we 
allocate the underlying risk that would 
be associated with The Gap filling okay 
so our our our stop would be above here 
but we are allowing with money 
management to endure if you will any 
closure of that Gap so that's going to 
be factored in 
granted that's a default when you're 
using the stop up here but it's not the 
same thing from mentally seeing it 
happen when you're in the trade you get 
short here but it comes up and fills the 
Gap you're going to be afraid you're 
going to feel fearful that it's going to 
keep on running you just got to stick to 
the protocol and trust that the Stop's 
going to do its job and the Gap may just 
close and that's all there is or it may 
go to consequent encouragement and 
that's all there 
is okay our last example this is 
cable uh we have the last up Clos candle 
bearish order block we have price 
created an Impulse price swing price 
comes back trades into the order block 
here now we want to see what we want to 
see the expansion price swing 
here the impulse price swing is the 
initial displacement the retracement is 
the retest of the order block then the 
expansion move where price really starts 
to get accelerated 
this is where we do not Chase it we just 
simply wait for the fair value Gap to 
form we have a fair value Gap right 
here right here okay and with that fair 
value Gap we wait for price to come back 
up into this candle High which is the 
fair value gaps low your short entry is 
there and 20 Pips is just the Shaded 
area and it does a whole lot more 
obviously 
here when we look at this model it's one 
thing to say okay there's a fair value 
Gap here's an order block okay I want 
you to go back and look at examples of 
every potential pair that you are 
considering in 
your career right now you know you may 
have just a few because I've told you so 
but eventually some of you are going to 
get really comfortable with looking 
through a larger portfolio and other 
asset classes and you'll start to see 
this pattern form on higher time frames 
and this could be your bread and set up 
for like a 15-minute time frame and 
doing intraday 
swings it's not limited to a 5-minute 
chart remember price is fractal it 
allows you to do it in every time frame 
this pattern still works on daily charts 
too so if you're a position Trader or a 
long-term swing Trader it's it exists 
there as well okay so don't think that 
I'm just giving you another day trader 
another scalping technique and I can't 
ever use that Michael why you wasting my 
time with this every one of these models 
are scalable 
you can expand them or reduce them to 
lower time frames down to a one minute 
chart it's completely up to you but the 
theory behind it and the narrative 
that's used is the same okay now in 
closing some of the things that make 
these setups better or higher 
probability is obviously within a Kill 
Zone within institutional order flow 
that's directionally derived in other 
words what is the directional bias in 
institutional orderflow in a daily chart 
if you're trading in that direction and 
inside of a Kill Zone and this pattern 
forms man is it a loaded deal it's just 
one of those easy low hanging fruit 
setups it's a very very easy model to 
find a setup with and it's one of those 
models that are very forgiving because 
some of you are complaining that and I'm 
not saying it's a bad thing it's normal 
for you to say I I can't see this real 
time well this is one of those very 
forgiving models where it kind of like 
acts like a crutch okay or training 
wheels there is an order block there you 
may have missed it and it 
retrodesign that's your entry technique 
your pattern and then trade it and take 
20 Pips out now how would you use this 
with a 
larger uh price action model or a larger 
time frame model uh you just don't look 
for that 20 Pips you just look for 
simple opposing PD arrays that means if 
you're bearish you're going to be 
looking for the very next discount array 
that will allow you or facilitate a 
healthy profit margin what is that well 
I don't know what your stops going to be 
they're all going to be different 
obviously you can see that every one of 
these setups here has a different scale 
in terms of pip per stop loss so if your 
model is going to force you to be a 5 to 
one setup Trader then obviously you know 
you want to consider that and where your 
scalings are going to be uh that's going 
to obviously skew the 5 to one modeling 
or gearing that you're you're trying to 
employ but you always want to find some 
way to create some first level of 
scaling this model is a one shot entry 
give me 20 Pips and leave a very very 
small portion on that's how I'm 
presenting it here so if you were 
scaling um say say you did the one 
standard lot in the form of 10 
minis you could take eight of those 
minis off at 20 Pips whenever you get 
first profit in the scalping model leave 
two Minis on to see if you can get 
anything else additional price movement 
for the next PD array whether it be you 
know premium array when you're going 
long or discount array when you're going 
short don't try to make more of this 
model than I just told you it's very 
very simple it's very easy and like I 
said it's very forgiving because it 
allows you to you Miss the boat okay on 
the ideal entry because the ideal entry 
would be selling up here okay or selling 
up here on the first fair value Gap 
right in here so that fair value Gap 
gets closed you can sell short but then 
you have to encounter all this 
consolidation till you get to the 
bearish order block retest there's a 
short optimal trade entry 
price expansion beautiful uh symmetrical 
price swing then another retrace back 
into now the fair value 
got price runs again standard low how 
many Pips below that do all your 
projections 10 15 you know you know the 
model and you can get the low here so 
you can take 20 off 20 Pips off here 
with eight of the 10 Minis on a one 
standard lot get ing but two minis would 
be on board to capture all the remaining 
portion here so you can you can expand 
this 
model also to use as entering a larger 
term price move you can actually use 
this to use additional entry uh 
technique other words if you have a 
larger price swing say say for whatever 
reason maybe you were lucky enough to 
get short up here you can use this model 
to add to an existing position 
okay so don't think that it's limited to 
a scalping model it's you're there's so 
many ways you can use these models and 
they'll dovetail once you get to know 
what what all of them can do over time 
and when you can plug and play certain 
ones obviously this pattern here is very 
very specific it requires you to do 
certain things in terms of waiting and 
the price has to prove itself to you and 
a lot of you may really resonate with 
this one because it's a very easy model 
very very easy it's highly Visual and 
it's principle based and even in its 
core Bare Bones you know just a skeleton 
with no more flesh added to it like 
we'll do in 2020 we start going back 
through these again and creating more of 
a trading plan type thing whereas right 
now I'm just giving you an idea okay 
it's a model to to discern where you are 
in one of these models and you can build 
on it flesh it 
out by itself I've given you enough to 
be a trading plan everything I just 
explained to you in concert with what 
I've taught you about money management 
and take profits and how to work within 
the pdra 
matrix it's you have a you have the 
entire trading plan right there the only 
thing I haven't done is go by step by 
step using the the criteria that creates 
a trading plan I'm just having a 
conversation with you like I'm assuming 
because you have experience with me now 
and you have experience in the market I 
can say what I've said to you and you 
can take that information and say okay I 
know exactly what he means by all that 
and I'm going to formulate a trading 
plan don't be discouraged if you don't 
feel that way that's okay because that's 
what the next round of going through 
these price action models is going to do 
we're actually going to sit down and put 
detail behind everything what is it 
we're supposed to be doing with all 
these individual models once that's done 
and you go back through them all 
collectively at the end of next year 
you'll feel much more confident about 
your understanding about price action as 
a whole and this is just going to be one 
small little facet in the greater hole 
of your understanding as it comes to 
price action so hopefully you found this 
insightful until I'll talk to you next 
time wish you good luck and good Trading
