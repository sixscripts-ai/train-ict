# ICT Model 12: Order Block + Fair Value Gap (OB+FVG) Scalping Model

## Overview
ICT Price Action Model Number 12 is a precision scalping model designed to capture 20-pip movements through the strategic combination of Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps. This model emphasizes "bread and butter" setups rather than attempting to capture absolute highs or lows.

## Core Objective
- **Target**: 20 pips per trade
- **Philosophy**: Consistent, reliable profits rather than home runs
- **Approach**: Wait for high-probability setups rather than forcing trades

## Key Components

### 1. Order Block Identification
- **Bearish Order Block**: Last two up-close candles before a significant move down
- **Bullish Order Block**: Last two down-close candles before a significant move up
- Must show clear institutional involvement (large volume, clean breaks)

### 2. Fair Value Gap (FVG) Requirements
- **Critical Rule**: The Fair Value Gap must NOT be directly linked to the Order Block candle
- **Separation Principle**: There must be clear separation between the OB and FVG formation
- **Quality Filter**: FVG should form during expansion moves, not consolidation

## Trading Sequence Protocol

### Phase 1: Order Block Formation
1. Identify last two opposing candles (up-close for bearish, down-close for bullish)
2. Wait for price to move away from the order block
3. Confirm institutional involvement through volume and clean breaks

### Phase 2: Retest and Expansion
1. Price returns to test the order block
2. **Expansion Price Swing**: Price accelerates away from the order block
3. **DO NOT CHASE**: Wait for the retracement setup

### Phase 3: Fair Value Gap Formation
1. Identify FVG during the expansion move
2. Ensure FVG is separate from the original order block candle
3. Wait for price to retrace back to the FVG

### Phase 4: Entry Execution
- **Short Entry**: At the high of the Fair Value Gap (for bearish setups)
- **Long Entry**: At the low of the Fair Value Gap (for bullish setups)
- **Target**: 20 pips from entry point
- **Stop Loss**: Above/below the Fair Value Gap with gap closure allowance

## Risk Management Framework

### Stop Loss Placement
- **Default**: Above the Fair Value Gap high (shorts) or below FVG low (longs)
- **Gap Closure Allowance**: Factor in potential full gap closure
- **Mental Preparation**: Expect gap fills and trust the stop loss protocol

### Position Sizing Strategy
- **Scalping Approach**: Take 80% profit at 20 pips
- **Continuation Setup**: Leave 20% for additional targets
- **Example**: 10 mini lots → Take 8 at 20 pips, leave 2 for extended moves

## Advanced Implementation

### Higher Probability Conditions
1. **Kill Zone Alignment**: Trade within institutional kill zones
2. **Directional Bias**: Align with daily institutional order flow
3. **Higher Timeframe Context**: Confirm direction on daily charts
4. **Market Structure**: Trade with the prevailing trend

### Multi-Timeframe Application
- **Scalability**: Works on all timeframes (1-minute to daily)
- **Fractal Nature**: Same principles apply across different time horizons
- **Position Trading**: Can be adapted for longer-term swings
- **Intraday Swings**: Excellent for 15-minute chart setups

## Entry Techniques and Variations

### Primary Entry Method
1. Wait for Fair Value Gap formation
2. Enter at gap boundary (high for shorts, low for longs)
3. Target 20 pips with tight risk management

### Additional Entry Opportunities
- **Add-on Positions**: Use for pyramiding existing trades
- **Second Chance Entries**: When initial optimal entry is missed
- **Larger Model Integration**: Combine with higher timeframe setups

## PD Array Matrix Integration

### Premium/Discount Considerations
- **Bearish Setups**: Look for premium levels (above 50% of range)
- **Bullish Setups**: Target discount levels (below 50% of range)
- **Equilibrium**: 50% level acts as decision point for gap fills

### Target Extensions
- **Beyond 20 Pips**: Use other PD arrays for extended targets
- **Relative Equal Highs/Lows**: Natural profit-taking levels
- **Liquidity Pools**: Identify where price may extend

## Model Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Forgiving Nature**: Allows for missed initial entries
- **High Visibility**: Easy to identify in real-time
- **Principle-Based**: Logical foundation for decision-making
- **Consistent Results**: Reliable 20-pip captures

### Limitations
- **Patience Required**: Must wait for complete setup formation
- **Gap Closure Risk**: FVGs may fill completely before moving
- **Broker Variations**: Different spreads affect exact entry levels

## Trading Plan Integration

### Pre-Market Analysis
1. Identify daily bias and institutional order flow
2. Mark key kill zones for the session
3. Locate potential order block areas from higher timeframes

### Real-Time Execution
1. Monitor for order block formation and initial moves
2. Wait for expansion and Fair Value Gap creation
3. Set alerts for gap retest levels
4. Execute with predetermined risk parameters

### Post-Trade Analysis
- Document gap fill behavior with your broker
- Track 20-pip success rate across different pairs
- Analyze performance within vs. outside kill zones

## Key Success Factors

### Mental Framework
- **Patience Over Aggression**: Wait for complete setups
- **Process Over Profits**: Focus on following the model correctly
- **Consistency Over Home Runs**: Aim for reliable 20-pip captures

### Technical Execution
- **Gap Separation**: Ensure FVG is not linked to OB candle
- **Expansion Confirmation**: Wait for clear acceleration away from OB
- **Entry Precision**: Use exact gap boundaries for entries

### Risk Control
- **Gap Closure Acceptance**: Mentally prepare for full gap fills
- **Stop Loss Discipline**: Trust the predetermined stop levels
- **Position Sizing**: Use appropriate lot sizes for 20-pip targets

## Model Variations and Extensions

### Scaling Strategies
- **80/20 Rule**: Take majority profit at 20 pips, leave small portion
- **Multiple Entries**: Use for adding to existing positions
- **Timeframe Adaptation**: Apply same logic across different charts

### Integration with Other Models
- **Larger Setups**: Use as entry technique for bigger moves
- **Confirmation Tool**: Validate other model entries
- **Risk Mitigation**: Provide alternative entries when primary setups fail

This model represents one of ICT's most accessible and forgiving trading approaches, making it ideal for traders developing their skills while still providing professional-level profit potential when executed correctly.
