okay folks welcome back ICT mentorship sell side the market maker models price action model number seven universal trade plan all right price action model number seven universal trade plan sell side of the market maker models like you've seen in every previous trade plan we have five stages to the trade plan it's preparation opportunity Discovery trade planning trade execution and finally trade Trade Plan management all right so we're going to be noting all medium and high impact events for the markets that you're following you're going to study the events on the week to come and consider how the current market structure and the calendar events may suggest a specific weekly profile for that week's range okay we're going to be preparing the idea or trade idea with determining the ipto data ranges over the last 20 trading days but this astris next to 20 can represent the last 20 Trade Days the last 40 trade days or the last 60 Trading days for the upod data range because it's a universal trade plan we use all of those potential ranges and we do not count Sundays note the highest high and the lowest low in the past 20 40 or 60 trading days this is your current dealing range inside this dealing range we look for the next draw on liquidity where is Price likely to trade to next below which old low we look for a discount PD array in the direction of the weekly range bias we anticipate price to move to a discount PD array that would support our weekly bias on a day and economic event found on the economic calendar with the current or next trading week this volatility injection is what we wait for this will be a run on basis of a low resistance liquidity run opportunity Discovery identify a discount PD array below the market that means wherever we're trading it now wherever we're at at Market below where that market price is we're focusing on a specific price that we'll likely reach down to before completing a market maker sell model we're going to wait for stage one or stage two redistribution periods to go short and Target the Terminus at the discount PD array identify a discount PDR old low below the market that price will likely reach down to begin a market maker buy model wait for stage one or stage two redistribution periods to go short and Target the Terminus at the discount PD array so what I've shown here is both selling short in a market maker sell model and now selling short on a market maker buy model so we're focusing only on the side of the marketplace that is likely to drop trade planning when the market is primed to drop lower we want to look for a convergence of both manipulation and price opposite to our trade bias at a time the economic calendar suggests a volatility injection will likely occur we will will short premium fair value gaps or short buy stops in a stage one or stage two redistribution when we are bearish we will frame a short entry when price has moved up into a 15minute or 5 minute premium fair value Gap PD array that converges with a standard deviation of no more than plus three standard deviation during London open or New York open we can Implement scalping protocols on this stage as well for further reduction in Risk when we are in a market maker buy model we will Target the sells side liquidity below the old lows at Terminus if we are in a market maker sell model we will Target the original consolidation of the market maker sell Trade Management model trade executions when we are bearish we will anticipate a 5-minute chart institutional order flow entry drill trade entry to form inside of a retracement higher during London open and or New York open kill zones or a buy stop raid that we will go short when it [Music] unfolds short trade management when we are entering a short we will place a sell limit order on all positions we will execute in our demo account we will use the standard deviation and PD array convergence minus 5 Pips as our entry price when using the cell limit order if multiple orders are used all use the same entry price in the cell limit order when we are entering a short we will place a limit order to take 20 Pips as our objective on one position we will place a second limit order to take 40 Pips as our second objective we will use multiple orders to manage the trade idea if you capture a 60 pip objective close 80% of the trade and see if it has more to run when we are entering a short we will note the premium array and standard deviation convergence we aim to enter at we will place our stop loss Above This High plus 20 Pips we will re-enter if the trade stops out we can monitor it for secondary entries day trades may require multiple attempts to secure a solid entry do not fear that when we ear in profit 25% of our expected objective stop loss can be reduced by 25% when we are in profit 50% of our expected objective stop loss can be reduced by 50% when the position is at 75% of the expected profit objective stop must be at break even and like every other trade plan you've seen these slides but for the sake of complete and drilling at home money management the position size calculation formula is your position size equals account Equity times your risk percent divided by your stop- loss and Pips position size is the amount of Leverage your trade or trades assume account Equity is the total amount in your trading account risk percent is the percent of risk you are willing to take on per trade the difference between the entry price and your stop loss is the number of Pips you will use to the divide the result of equity times R per or risk percent an example account Equity at $2,000 risk per trade is 1.5% or 20,000 * 1.5% bringing us to a dollar amount of $300 stop requires for this trade 20 Pips so in microl lots that would be 1K each or 10 10 cents per pip 20 Pips at 10 cents is $2 risked $300 divided by $2 equals 150 micr Lots per trade or 1.5% of the account Equity always round down and again the Assumption here is we're going to be looking at Min Lots same Equity balance of 20,000 one and a half% risk $300 is still the maximum amount of risk for the trade 20 Pips is the stop in many Lots that's 10,000 leverage each and at $1 per pip so 20 Pips at a dollar per pip that's $20 risk and $20 divided into $300 of the one and half% Equity risk divided by $20 gives us a maximum of 15 mini Lots per trade or one and a half% of the account equity and again always round down and if you're going to use using standard Lots which I always tell a grow not to do because it doesn't give you that flexibility but using a standard lot which would be $10 per pip 20 Pips stop at $10 per pip is $200 and that can only allow you one and a half standard Lots which you have to round down to one standard lot so you can see the difficulty in framing your ideal risk management when using standard Lots standard lots are not ideal for optimal risk management if your demo account takes a loss on a trade and it is the full risk percent you assumed drop that risk percent by 50% on your next trade when the loss is recovered by 50% of the initial loss other words if you lost $300 if you make back $150 then you can go back to your original risk percent you're then permitted to return to the maximum R per per trade however if your reduced R per trade assumes a loss you reduce the r perc by 50% again and you do this until the previous trade loss is recovered by 50% this allows leveling in your draw down versus just a roller coaster decline if you take a series of five winning trades in a row drop your risk percent by 50% and the reason why is because you're likely to assume a loss eventually and this will build in equity leveling and reduce the likelihood of a large draw down you want a smooth Equity curve that slopes or stair steps higher not a jagged roller coaster with deep Sample Sets declines all right start back testing now you're going to be collecting multiple sample sets with this trade plan if you're unclear about some of the process rewatch The lessons on this price action model I will provide sample sets but do not rely or wait for mine dig into your charts and study what was provided here all right folks this is Algorithmic Lecture going to be our algorithmic lecture and discussion on price action model number seven it's a universal trading model it specifically targets sells high low resistance liquidity runs and fractals so obviously I gave you a little bit of a long one for model number six and a lot of the things I said in model 6 algorithmic lecture is obviously reversed so this one won't be as long because I'll be just basically saying the opposite of whatever I said in the previous model so I kind of like when leave you with the ideas that when you're looking for trades and you're looking for setups whether you're a short-term Trader a day trader a scalloper or swing or position Trader the main thing is looking for these types of setups okay now initially when I first set off to be a Trader in 1992 I was overwhelmed obviously with a lot of the things that my uncle used to talk to me about when I was 15 and 16 years old and would one go in one year out the other and over the time of learning and enduring a lot of hardships I have discovered that the fastest markets are going to be the markets that decline okay uh it's easy for people to want to pull out out and not want to be a part of the the game okay and that's why I believe the market goes down as fast as it does it's not because sellers are pushing it down it's the fact that the market is rushing to get them before they get out at their own price and what do I mean by that well think of a stock market crash you know when they crash or any Market crashes it's pretty Relentless and the relationships of the cell side low resistance liquidity runs versus that of the long side or you buy side low resistance liquidity runs the cell side generally performs the most aggressive the most ferocious they're they're Speedy they're very quick they're violent um they they can tend to be a little bit more uh volatile and the magnitude of the move tends to be much more exaggerated than that of a buy side low resistance liquidity run okay so what do I mean by that let's just say we're looking at a bearish market and we have anticipated the market running up into a period of resistance of some sort of Premium PD we're looking for it to sell off and when we get to Second Stage distribution while I teach you to look for this area over here it's important for you to also consider the intermarket relationship ships the macroeconomic and geopolitical front that's at the time of the trade you're taking and there's a lot of things that could lead to a major meltdown in the marketplace right now at the time of this recording so in 2022 you know we could be looking at things that would you know send these markets rocking and reeling but putting that aside mean some you're like oh he's bringing that ATT foil hat no not here but the second stage distribution when the Market's bearish it's important to note when this is forming is it likely to create an overzealous uh um an exaggerated type of selloff because not every short opportunity is going to create that but if you're in a climate where it presents that opportunity for instance consider crude oil a little while back when we watched it go negative $40 a barrel it created a scenario like this where it was just parabolic just kept on Supply and Demand going down now that was a real supply and demand Factor because it's a commodity Commodities are real supply and demand markets it's a real thing folks okay you need oil to run Machinery automobiles things like that and when they shut down the economy and you just simply can't turn off the pumps and the wells rather uh it takes a little bit of doing to make that stop so they had to keep pumping oil and they were basically paying people to come get their oil so that move where it just completely just fell out of bed just blew out every objective you know I think I had like $11 was my target for oil and it it just went right on through that and went below zero and I would have put my enti ire Fortune well it would never have done something like that and I would have lost so it's a testimonial to understanding how when these markets are primed to go down whatever Market it is if we're looking at Second Stage distributions like this in a market that's bearish it's really important to do an extra lap or two in your analysis to see can this overd deliver from what you're expecting can it go way beyond that and most of the time it won't let's be fair okay but it's important to note and I wanted to draw a contrast between that of what I was giv you for the BYO resistance liquidity run signatures in the market maker models versus the cell side low resistance liquidity run because these markets are designed to take from you and whoever else participates obviously ly the idea is they sell the idea or commodity or currency or Market okay they are the seller they're the sell side of the market so they're providing the the liquidity to buy something if they want to reprice it lower and get liquidity below the marketplace they're going to aggressively go lower faster because it's going to drive those sell stocks or cell side liquidity into the market for them to cover and buy from and that's the reason why when these markets are crashing they create these parabolic real sudden where it's almost instantaneous one minute it's at one price and then it's down so much you hear about it called the flash crash and they they blame it on all the things that would would otherwise be accepted because of you people just don't know but these markets repriced because they want them to be repriced at that level and you have to be careful and be able to discern when you're looking at these types of setups here second stage Distribution on a cells side low resistance liquidity run this is those setups that really overd deliver and go Way Beyond even my best objective for targets so that's different from when we're looking for buy side low resistance equility runs and it's a second stage reaccumulation where you're trying to buy that second little retrac before it blasts off now you will catch parabolic moves when it's extremely bullish using that for model number six but I want to draw a a stark contrast between that of the buy side versus the sell side low resistance liquidity run because this one here is what everybody is fearful of but they don't know how to find them so when the Market's conditioned to go lower and everything is just just point going down and it creates this model here second stage distribution can be a amazing selloff point where you can see it coming and there's been a few times where I was in markets where I've read them wrong early on in the late 90s and because of my understanding about this fractal and the understanding of how price is delivered it kept me from getting caught in limit down moves in the meets in grains Okay I I was looking at markets thinking I was going to try to catch the bottom and I I just was doing it foolishly I was I was admittedly taking a gamble but because I was able to see these types of things here it prevented me from holding on and then if I would have held on to it my account would have been locked limit for a few days and it's not fun if you have 10 20 contracts of something that can move a Sell Side lot so on the sell side of the curve of a market buy model this isn't going to be as bearish as the one I just described where this is more or less it's going to be parabolic for a short time to get to an objective we're looking for versus let me go back up one slide where this one's already part of a bearish market move and we're expecting it to go up to some kind of a premium just to see them send it lower again so this is just like the last bus stop before you head into tasse okay versus this short where if you go into second stage distribution here we're not expecting or wouldn't expect where we wouldn't expect a parabolic crash where it's we're seeing a controlled demolition to a level where we anticipate seeing a return or a reverse from here to start going higher so when you're looking at your markets you want to make sure you're trying to draw a distinction between what type of move are you looking for even though you're in second stage distribution or second stage accumulation whether you're bullish or bearish you have to make a distinction between what type of move should it be is it control demolition where it's going down to a level that you anticipate seeing support being found it moves from that discount to a premium or is it likely to fall off a cliff and just completely melt those distinctions need to be considered when you're doing your analysis if you fail to do that one of two things can happen number one you can miss an amazing opportunity to capture a windfall profit or you'll fall victim to that and not see it coming and worst case scenario be offside and you just get smashed and in those types of moves you can see your stop loss doesn't do the best job because it can repic easy beyond your stop in the first trated price that's where your Market order well your your stop would be triggered and it becomes a huge amount of slippage from where you hoped that your stock would execute versus where you're actually being filled because the market price has moved Way Beyond your stop loss and I know that sounds like it shouldn't be possible but that's how the market Works folks I mean that's That's the basis of liquidity and repricing and that's the reason why I teach this way because I want you to understand that you want to be doing the most work in determining what side of the market place is likely to deliver so that way you're really putting an emphasis on you trying to be in sync with the market versus trying to pick a top or trying to pick a bottom and at first glance you know a neoy or someone that hasn't been spending any time with me would consider this as someone trying to pick a bottom and it's not the assumption is this is already a bullish market and the markets Consolidated broke down returned back to consolidation first stage distribution second stage distribution that takes us then to a level where we anticipate a measure of support then we look for a turn Okay so this can be applied to a intraday basis or a market reversal like say New York reversal profile or it could be a weekly profile where this is Monday and tues Tuesday Wednesday Thursday creates the low of the week and then starts to trade higher and you get completely reversed weekly range where it completely takes out the high of the week and closes above it or it doesn't necessarily have to CL close above it but this fractal much like I mentioned in model number six's lecture is universal it can be applied in all time frames and knowing the distinctions and that characteristic that model 6 doesn't have whereas model 7 does because it's focusing on the sell side of the marketplace you're looking at the relationships of the market maker buy model that should not present a crash scenario this is just going to go down to a discount to go higher whereas the market maker cell model and its second stage distribution if you are not considering the overall economic climate the geopolitical climate uh look what we just went through with the covid nonsense look at what we were about to go through again because of all the things that they're trying to cook up so they're making a scenario for the fall of 2022 that means like late last week of August to September October November and that the cinity we could see some pretty crazy declines this year much more violent than some of us might expect especially if we do not continue higher up in the stock indices like we've had a little bit of a retracement here higher if it has run out of steam or if it goes up a little bit more and then Peters out and starts to go down and we're working lower into the month of August that really sets the stage for in my opinion that type of scenario right there where we are in an area where that can create that second stage distribution that is absolutely Bonkers like it could create big declines because there's a lot at risk in the US markets because of the midterm elections all the things that's going on and food you know food prices you food prices are going to create situations where you that element for a bullish Market because commodity prices are going up the sell models okay would create these types of events where it's going down but it's going to go down to pick up the discount to send those commodity prices higher like grains and meats and like the energies I think the energies are going to go ballistic like crude oil I honestly I don't even have a target for crude oil I just think the moon okay I think they are absolutely going to put the screws to everyone because they had to go through $40 a barrel you think that they're just going to sit back and eat that no way that's why we're seeing what we're seeing so gas prices are going up oil prices are going up natural gas is going to go up everybody's going to have a enormous bill for heating cooling their homes and fueling their vehicles and if you use heating oil that's probably going to be outrageous too so in those instances where we have a marketer buy model and we're on the sell side of the curve we could see models like this in those Commodities where it goes down and even though we have a second stage distribution it could be a sharp decline but it's going down to create this longer term bullish scenario not something like this where I don't I don't think this is going to be the case for Energy prices because they have a lot of money to make they weren't making money when everything was shut down because of Co nobody could go anywhere you know vacations couldn't be had uh travel was impacted so I don't think that this is the event that we'll see for energies I think it is a matter of the opposite we're looking for it to drop down to pick up a discount to go higher and it may not even drop down you know we might be just seeing parabolic price moves from you know summer into you know mid October or something to that effect because think about it like this if you are a company that provides well let's say it like this say you are heating oil company and you subscribe to the Futures Market the key tabs on when you have to be buying your oil because you have to be a merchant okay you have to buy it when it's cheap and buy it before it gets too expensive well if we're in a climate like we have right now where Energy prices could obviously go parabolic higher and there's no reason for it to go down they have ailt to invested interest to make trillions of dollars doing it then we have to understand that risk so we're not going to look at this type of event if it's going up to a premium to drop down like this we wouldn't expect that in the energies we would expect it to be a a control demolition where it goes down just to pick up a discount to go higher but it may not like I said it may not even drop we may just see par parallel price rallies so it's going to be painful for a lot of folks but hopefully you've learned something in this mentorship that'll help at least mitigate some of that expense that's coming your way and none of us can avoid it and if you have the distinctions made beforehand before you do your trades if you're in a a bearish market like this that second stage distribution always be mindful go through and think are we in a situation that could create this as a crashing scenario because if it is you trade it differently you don't take the bulk of your trade off here you take a small portion of and you just let it ride.
