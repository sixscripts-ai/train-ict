# ICT Model 9: One Shot, One Kill Trading Model - Processed Knowledge Base

## Overview
- **Objective**: 50-75 pips per week on consistent basis
- **Classification**: Weekly range expansion model
- **Target Days**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday for high/low formation
- **Philosophy**: Single high-probability trade per week approach

## Core Framework
- **Stage**: Weekly range expansion (institutional order flow analysis)
- **Setup**: Day of week focus (Mon-Wed for weekly high/low)
- **Pattern**: Inefficiencies (liquidity voids and fair value gaps) to liquidity runs
- **Timeframe**: Weekly chart for bias, lower timeframes for entry

## Key Insights - Liquidity Classification

### External Range Liquidity
- **Definition**: Liquidity outside current short-term dealing range
- **Examples**: Double top highs, double bottom lows
- **Purpose**: Target levels for breakouts and stop runs

### Internal Range Liquidity
- **Components**: Fair value gaps, liquidity voids, order blocks
- **Function**: Entry points within current dealing range
- **Location**: Inside present short-term dealing range

### Critical Trading Rule
**"Most of the time internal range liquidity entries will run to external range liquidity"**

- **Standard Approach**: Enter at order blocks/FVGs → Target external liquidity
- **Reverse Approach**: Turtle soup entries at external liquidity → Target internal liquidity
- **Application**: All ICT trades frame on one of these two conditions

## Liquidity Run Dynamics

### Low Resistance Liquidity Runs
- **From Internal to External**: Order block/FVG entry → External range target
- **From External to Internal**: Turtle soup entry → Internal range target
- **Characteristic**: Smooth price movement toward liquidity pools

### Imbalance vs Inefficiency Terminology
- **Buy Side Imbalance** = **Sell Side Inefficiency** (same concept)
- **Sell Side Imbalance** = **Buy Side Inefficiency** (same concept)
- **Context Dependent**: Terminology varies based on analysis perspective

## Market Structure Understanding

### Buy Side Imbalance Characteristics
- **Formation**: Market rallies quickly from significant low
- **Result**: Porous price action with inefficiencies
- **Cause**: Too much buying, insufficient sell-side liquidity
- **Rebalancing**: Requires sell-side delivery to correct

### Sell Side Imbalance Characteristics
- **Formation**: Market drops quickly from significant high
- **Result**: Gaps in price action due to rapid decline
- **Cause**: Too many offers, insufficient buy-side liquidity
- **Rebalancing**: Requires buy-side delivery to correct

## Multi-Model Integration Strategy

### Primary Model Failure Protocol
1. **First Choice**: One Shot, One Kill (weekly high/low)
2. **Backup Plan**: Model 8 (25 pips weekly target)
3. **Final Option**: Scalping model for loss mitigation

### Professional Adaptation Approach
- **Flexibility**: Don't limit to single model approach
- **Opportunity Capture**: Use multiple models to avoid missed weeks
- **Loss Mitigation**: Drop down to smaller timeframe models when primary fails
- **Risk Management**: Adapt rather than force trades

## Stop Loss Management Integration

### Multi-Model Stop Movement
- **Trigger**: When lower timeframe models reach their targets
- **Application**: Move stops on higher timeframe positions
- **Example**: Scalping model reaches target → Move One Shot, One Kill stop
- **Benefit**: Protect profits while maintaining position for larger move

## Weekly Analysis Protocol

### Top-Down Analysis Sequence
1. **Monthly Chart**: Overall institutional order flow direction
2. **Weekly Chart**: Range expansion direction and bias
3. **Daily Chart**: Specific entry setups and timing
4. **Lower Timeframes**: Precise entry execution

### Consistency Framework
- **Narrative Adherence**: Stick with price action story until proven wrong
- **Bias Maintenance**: Don't change direction based on external opinions
- **Invalidation Signals**: When trades consistently fail in opposite direction
- **Professional Response**: Cut losses and reassess opposite direction

## Fractal Nature of Price Action

### Universal Application
- **Same Charts**: All traders view identical price data
- **Unique Interpretation**: Individual perspective creates different approaches
- **Profitable Variations**: Multiple valid trading methods from same data
- **Personal Evolution**: Trading style naturally evolves over time

### Individual Development Path
- **Learning Phase**: Study all models broadly
- **Natural Gravitation**: Identify personally resonating approaches
- **Flexibility Maintenance**: Remain open to style evolution
- **Independence Goal**: Develop autonomous analysis capability

## Risk and Expectation Management

### Realistic Expectations
- **Not 100% Accuracy**: Expect losses and adverse results
- **Learning Curve**: Growing pains are normal part of development
- **Consistency Over Perfection**: Focus on long-term edge
- **Professional Mindset**: More right than wrong over time

### Loss Integration Strategy
- **Learning Opportunity**: Greatest lessons come from losing trades
- **Scar Tissue Effect**: Each loss builds trading resilience
- **Emotional Callousness**: Develop immunity to short-term fluctuations
- **Seasoned Perspective**: Professional traders unaffected by minor setbacks

## Implementation Guidelines

### Weekly Preparation
- **Weekend Analysis**: Complete analysis before Monday
- **Anticipation Practice**: Predict likely scenarios
- **Independence Building**: Reduce reliance on external guidance
- **Responsibility Acceptance**: Take ownership of trading decisions

### Model Selection Criteria
- **Personality Fit**: Choose models that resonate personally
- **Skill Development**: Master chosen approach through repetition
- **Backup Planning**: Maintain alternative approaches for flexibility
- **Evolution Allowance**: Remain open to changing preferences

## Advanced Concepts

### Candy Land Reference
- **Double Top Stops**: Expected to be swept most times
- **Return Pattern**: Price returns inside previous range
- **Internal Liquidity Seeking**: Targets FVGs, equilibrium, order blocks
- **Recapitalization**: Smart money repositioning at key levels

### Order Flow Understanding
- **No External Data**: Analysis based purely on price action
- **Range Identification**: Determine current trading boundaries
- **Breakout Targeting**: Exit positions at range breaks
- **Scaling Strategy**: Partial exits at external liquidity levels

## Key Success Factors

1. **Liquidity Awareness**: Understand internal vs external dynamics
2. **Model Flexibility**: Use multiple approaches as needed
3. **Bias Consistency**: Maintain directional conviction until invalidated
4. **Risk Management**: Integrate stop movement across models
5. **Expectation Realism**: Accept losses as part of process
6. **Continuous Learning**: Cycle through lessons repeatedly
7. **Independence Development**: Build autonomous analysis skills
8. **Professional Mindset**: Focus on long-term consistency over perfection

This model represents the pinnacle of ICT's weekly trading approach, combining high-probability setups with sophisticated risk management and multi-model integration for consistent profitability.
