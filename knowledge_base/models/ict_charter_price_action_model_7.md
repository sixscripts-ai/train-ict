# ICT Charter Price Action Model 7

*Extracted from: ICT Charter Price Action Model 7.docx*

all right folks welcome back uh I first of all I want to thank you for your patience and not freaking out and sending me emails or tweets where's the lesson number seven price action model supplementary lesson you said it was going to be on the 30th I was exhausted I worked a lot this week for you all and on the the free member level uh I just want to make sure I give my best effort to Showcase how reading price and reading the tape which is going to be the topic of this discussion and how I can do that you know in real time so that was the point of the recording so that way I can come back and tell you all in Charter level uh some of the things that I did in those videos that you won't readily pull out you'll look at what I'm doing and it won't make any sense like it doesn't look like he's following any of his rules and I am it's just the chart on a one minute is skewed and I'll explain in a moment what that means and how you overcome that or at least how I overcome it this is that one minute fractal that I traded and I I went along down in here and sold short up here and then rote it down into the equal lows here getting on over here and you guys already saw all that in the video I want to talk a little bit about what I hinted at in the the YouTube video that I posted uh this past week and I dropped a little bit of a a gem and I didn't mean to do it actually I thought I was in a mentorship recording but I'm glad I said it so vaguely it really went over top of everyone's head I'm sure they have no idea what I was talking about but it's really important so this is the part where I believe that folks Like the quote unquote professionals that say that there's noise on these lower intraday charts it's not that it's noise there's Distortion admittedly I will grant them that but that's not Noise Okay I want to build a short little bit of a foundation as to why this is Les this lesson is so important uh when I first started trading it was during the open outcry markets that means when we traded the markets we would call our broker with a push button or rotary actually I had a rotary uh phone when I was trading so that means you would put your finger in a little hole spinning around on the face of the uh phone let go of it and it would spin back yeah that's what I was trading with but uh usually the only Touchstone phone I had was when I was on a pay phone stopping in the middle of my route to do any kind of Trad or adjust my stop so the procedure was this I had a little quot Trek machine that I carried around which was bigger than a smartphone today and it had a little aerial antenna like a old radio you would telescopically pull it out and I had it more or less duct taped you know with a makeshift mount on my delivery truck windshield so I would look at it like we would look at a GPS unit today in modern time I was constantly looking at the bond market and the S&P Market and if I was in a currency or a grain market I'd have that quote up there too and I would be constantly watching it what I was doing was teaching myself without myself knowing how to read the tape and when I say reading the tape what does that mean it's a skill set that once you understand it you can literally trade off of the ticker tape on Q uh like what's it CNBC yeah CNBC it was F fnc when I was coming up as a Trader but now today it's called Uh CNBC and every 10 minutes at the bottom of the the ticker tape the Futures Market will give you the updated where it's trading right now and you can literally watch this every 10 minutes and and write down where the highest high and the lowest low you saw quoted and then you would just keep track of that okay on the floor Floor Traders back then when we would call in our order we would call our broker wait for the order desk to pick up and then we would say what trading desk we would be on like I would be on H desk at Lind waldock so they would answer the phone hello Lind waldock how can I help you uh hesk please hold for one momento they put you over to the H desk hesk can I have your order right away to business they don't like how you doing nothing like that can I have your order and you have to tell them like I want to buy five December SPO at whatever price or at the market with a stop at this and limit order this and good till cancel that means the order's good forever okay or if you just know it's going to be uh today's order you would just say you know it's only for today it's day order only they would say Okay hold for your uh Phill if it was a market order you said like buy me now or sell me now and you tell them I'll hold for confirmation they say Okay hold for one second they push on hold okay sir we've sold five December SPO at blah blah blah the price and here's your order number any other orders no sir all right thank you that's it you're done that was the process okay you guys are all spoiled okay you get on a click and click and click and you're done we had to the whole time the Market's moving around we're trying to get a hold of someone before they could even do all the processes of getting us in or adjusting our stop or you know getting out all that stuff was going on at the same time so it was important to know what the markets were doing from a tape reading standpoint because when Markets started to run I wanted to be getting out that way I had time if I'm in a long and S&P were rallying and I was catching two and a half points and that sounds silly now today because of volatility but two and a half points or three points in in a morning session like that was the that was it like you were getting that's the full Daily range anything above three or four was like crazy volatility and and it was moving a lot but we were making careers on on that little bit of a movement that's okay but nonetheless once the start once the move started taking place and I was in along and it was rallying up I was calling my broker if I felt that I needed to be getting out of it which at that time was a lot because once I got profit on my open position I'd freak out and want to take my profit because I was a new Trader but I learned that wanting to get out when the markets are moving in my favor it presented me time to find the phone call it wait for the order desk J J the guy to confirm and then once I'm out of the marketplace that's all time and the whole time the Market's moving so that was one of the things that taught me how to exit like I do and look for liquidity because in the beginning I didn't understand where liquidity pools were where the market would be drawn to I was just trying to get out while I was moving in my favor because of that condition of having to trade with that huge time impediment where it was just too much of a barrier to get Beyond if you were scalping or day trading and not sitting by some kind of a C Machine and even though I had it I was driving around through the bottom Washington area on a delivery truck trying to do all that stuff so what you watched me do this week you know plate spinning and and annotating charts before it happens in real time I'm used to that level of nuts okay because I was doing that as a as a route delivery driver filling machines so the machines giving people back their refund and I'm looking at my quot Trek the whole time thinking I got to call this broker and this woman wants her $150 back because it got stuck in the machine or whatever I mean it was nuts okay so what tape reading was what was the result of doing all those types of things I ended up becoming a good tape reader and talking with real Floor Traders from the bond Pit and the uh SPO pit S&P Market I had the privilege to meet real Traders on the floor and they more or less explained to me how they did this and I'm going to explain it to you but you're going to be able to see it graphically okay and it'll make a lot more sense many times you'll see me put in examples on Twitter and I'll say hey like what do you see do you see the market maker sell model do you see the market maker buy model and invariably everyone has their boxes painted on in different places and it doesn't make any sense okay what they're trying to do is just make something look similar to the overall model so that way I'll either like that tweet or I'll comment on it and I generally try to avoid it because most of the time they're drawing it wrong and I'm going to show you what it looks like right now this is the actual one minute chart and then what tape reading does it gives you Clarity okay so it's going to require a little bit of on screen photoshopping okay and what your heart just skipped a beat didn't I knew it ict's a photoshopper but I was trying to figure out how I can communicate this to you and show it to you in a visual representation of what goes on in my mind so it's going to make a whole lot more sensitive just trust me come along with me but in me in the meanwhile everyone should see the be uh be able to see the consolidation here okay we had the original consolidation we had the displacement come back into the order block fill in this bissy buy it buy stops above here run boom get out sell short the draw is this level as I mentioned in the review just a little while ago same day today August 31st 2019 you'll see that that's a fair value Gap up here on cable okay so this watch the recording of the market review on August 31st 2019 if you're seeing this video later on uh that's what this level is okay so I don't want to drive too much more information around it than what's necessary because I don't want the video to be already longer than it needs to be so using the market maker cell model you could be a buyer on the buy side of the curve buying it here and distributing your long and looking to go short at the Smart money reversal lowrisk cell is over here now where in all of this are you going to draw your box for the distribution cycle the little red boxes that usually get painted on before they run down and take out the equal low where do you draw that and all this you see what makes it confusing don't you this is the part that people like at Goldman Sachs and UBS and all the other guys that are quote unquote institutional Traders they don't have the visibility because they're looking at depth of Market they're looking at other things okay and they're looking at their own order flow coming into their desks I'm going to show you what really is going on from an interbank level today okay so forget time forget that for I'm going to ring that in in a moment but think about the range the the price range itself that's what I'm monitoring okay when price ran up from this level here to here it did so in less than 10 minutes because each one of these candles is is one minute candle this imbalance and it runs up into that consequent encroachment also inside of the area where on this me put the vertical line in here so you can see it this is the highest point see it there's the highest point in the run up so in this market maker sell model all this is on the buy side of the curve smart money reversal after hits a PD array or premium array in the form of the fair value Gap as I mentioned in the market review for August 31st 2019 look at the cable portion of that video and that'll unlock what this level is here then we have Distribution on the downside we wait what are we doing we're waiting to sell short well I sold short right in here knowing that this is likely to be a turning point not coming back up to this level here because that would be what everyone else expects that thinks they understand order blocks look at this down closed candle right in here it's not likely to expand outside this down closed candle let me show you what that looks like so as I'm watching price in cable this particular day I know that this byy side of the curve this is a point at which they're going to mitigate on the left side of the smart money reversal remember all this is pricing in just to go lower that's the market maker sell model so price action model number seven focuses on the cell side expansion of this model I zeroed right on that point right there because it was inside of this range and it's the consequent encroachment of this single down closed candle midpoint inside of this range here because everything we move back up into this candle here there should be selling here in this area between these two candles bodies there should be selling off in there too but where is it in here like this you can understand using this candle we're carrying it all the way to the other side of the curve on the model so we're carrying that area of previous buying they took it down below it so now they're going to mitigate they need to mitigate in here so anything short they're on and they're offside they have to get off of it as it runs up that gives IA gives them a chance to get out of their long and now go short offering liquidity as a counterparty for the new New Market participants that are trading at the market right now or there may be transactions that are coming in from a Commerce level uh a business Global entity Microsoft um Adobe uh some country that's working internationally you know they're going to move their order in based on this area here but they're going to try to price that transaction unless the customer puts in uh variables that they don't want to go beyond they will work that order flow and then do all their transactions with that that's what the bank Traders do IA is pricing back to this level so they can do those types of things secondly now we have all of this extended range and it's a Time range that distorts the model and it keeps people from seeing it this is the part that took me forever to figure out but once I got it it was game set and match no time frame eludes me now okay so we have all of this price range in here all right so we have an order block here and then we have an order block here and then we have an order block here we could be a seller here a seller here a seller here a seller here you see what I'm saying forget all that forget all that okay this entire range here to here is skewed it's completely skewed there's actually two portions of price action in here there's two distribution areas where the market goes up the sell off and goes down goes up here sells off and then goes down again but you cannot see it readily because of all this elongation because of time this is why I stress the fact that the time element the chart that's not the reason that makes the market go anywhere okay IPA will hold price in this window or range in price to facilitate trade what do I mean by that if we go and look at this little area right in here this is the distribution area usually this would be like a red box in the market maker sell model and then the other one is here oops might not have been a to get that the right way me get that there you go the other one's here okay now why why is it this area right here why am I picking this little area right at of all this stuff why is this and this the areas I'm focusing on because if you look at where we were in terms of the range this is the Range High here and then we have a low right there okay so this is our dealing range if we looked at just a one minute chart very very disorienting it's hard to make any sense out of that unless you know what you're looking for so we have an area distribution here and we have an area distribution here in terms of price range okay distribution distribution so if we return up into this area like we do here this is your cell so you can see a distribution cycle which is lowrisk cell redistribution and then once we come out of the bottom of that right in here would be your second red box so it's usually the gray box a red box a red box and it might be another distribution cycle and it would be here and plunges down and clears the original consolidation and sells side liquidity if you can see the price range okay that has been held in here I don't care about all these candles I'm not looking at what's an up close and down close I'm looking at we made the Range High here and the body of this candle is there at 2282 so I'm watching when price breaks below that it does so here on this candle and then we return right back up into this distribution area so what we have to do is completely ignore and this is very tricky I know it's going to be seeming like oh no we just went way off the deep end now I don't know what I'm talking about or you don't know what I'm talking about rather trust me give me a moment and I'm going to flush out a little bit more but if we didn't have all of these candles and we just had this portion of price action bump up to the bottom of this in this area here it would look more like a standard Market maker sell model but because price has been held in this range on a one minute basis every candle price hasn't moved price hasn't moved price hasn't moved price hasn't moved price hasn't moved I mean it's Mo moving very small very micro uh fluctuations but it's basically staying inside of a specific range and the range is inside of these previous buy areas buy areas and now they're mitigating and mitigating and holding it giving them a chance to get short build their short positions build their short position the fact that we're looking at the the element of time through the scope of one minute candles it will skew the information that's why generally 15minute charts and 60-minute charts are much more refined in terms of the looking at the market maker sell models and buy models not that you can't see them like I've shown you here on this one minute chart but you have to visually see what's going on so the aspect of tape reading comes in like this smart money reversal here low risk sell then we have a period of distribution in other words they look to sell more inside of the previous area of accumulation so they bought long in here it ran up counterparty liquidity they sell here to willing buyers and it goes short now here's a lowrisk sell this is where people that understand this measure of trading they can get in short but they're missing on the really smart money entry then we wait for this move here which returns back up into this area there's your redistribution or an area that sells short and then you have that range but I'm looking over here so I'm monitoring how price is sitting in here I'm not looking at up closed candles to sell short at I'm not looking for fair value gaps I'm watching this range in here because in any time in this area here I can get short I'm not worried about trading back up into anything I know I'm inside of the range to work with him because I'm over here in the previous area of accumulation of Longs so if we were able to take all of this information here out of the um the one minute chart it would look like this okay I took all that stuff and compressed it into to a smaller one so now you can see we have the original buy side displacement reaccumulation back to uh fair value and bullish order block so it say reaccumulation alongs runs up reaccumulation alongs smart money reversal lowrisk sell redistribution redistribution sell off run for the equal lows or sell side liquidity so this is what it looks like when you have the market maker sell model and you look past all of the Distortion it's not it's noise noise would be you have no idea what's going on I know what I'm looking for and it's just exactly what I just outlined here you need to determine where the ranges are on the B side of the curve and monitor how price is fluctuating through that if we start breaking above the previous points of accumulation on The Bu side of the curve that means you do not have a cell model at all it means you have an area where they're going to reate and go long these areas on the buy side of the curve of a cells side model they are your points of reference you're not in you're not just staring into the abyss trying to figure out what's going on you're looking specifically at predetermined price ranges and even on a one minute basis you can see how IPA is respecting those previous ranges it's not that IPA is seeing one minute candles it's not that the one minute candle is just depicting what the range has been for that one minute interval but time is a a manipulative side of EPA you have to know what the dealing ranges are and the interbank order flow interbank order flow is what I just showed you right here I'm cutting through all the BS of a one minute chart and getting right down to the nuts and bolts of what the order flow is on that level not order flow from an Institutional standpoint because they can't see this way you can I can and it creates visibility so if we know the draw on liquidity is here anything up here like I just outlined here okay I didn't create or paint new candles all I did was took what was existing all this stuff out and I just took this fractal here scooted it over here and there it is it's done I got rid of all this Distortion now you're photoshopping charts and I'm confused Michael you're making stuff up you're going to see lots of examples like this that was the reason why I chose to start doing one minute charts because I can show you with visibility with proof that I can see what's going to happen before it happens because I understand how to read the tape when I'm when I tell you I'm reading the tape I'm reading what IPA is doing what it's following it's it's has a macro that it's following certain procedures it has to do the element of time that is the variable that was the hardest for me because that's the part that screws every everybody up on retail how long is this move going to take to get there when will the move take place how long will it take before it starts and how long will it take before it finishes that is a variable that took me a lot of time to master that's the part that I'm just wasn't willing to sit in there and give to the world in free tutorials because I watched what they and they're still doing it now they're just completely you know disrespecting the level of work that took to get this it took a lot of work and and and patience and obedience okay to get this and just to have people you know s around and treating like they do it's just disgusting but nonetheless I want you to understand that the one minute chart is not noise there are periods of distortion but there's perceptions that you can have only by referencing the previous areas of accumulation here of lungs carry those levels over on the cell side of the curve which is to the right of the smart money reversal and you're gonna need to watch this video several times okay I know already you're like a deer in headlights listening I have no idea what he's saying I'm hope he gets it makes it easier it'll be easier by me showing you examples and examples and examples okay just know that all of this stuff here and this noise that it would be called by anyone else it's just them inside of a dealing range IPA does not price based on a time chart it prices by way of time and price so it's not the Candlestick chart it's not the time frame that creates the setups it didn't say oh look at that order block on 50 minutes that was the buy that was the that's not how this works okay it it's not how it works it's time and price now I'm not going to go out on limb and tell you that I know every aspect of their time portion of the algorithm because when I lose that's the part I lose because of it's not generally because I'm wrong on the direction it's usually because my timing was off and I messed it up there but as far as directional bias and seeing once they start spooling price and like like here I already know what's going to happen I mean and I can work within it you I put on a clinic in price action with a one minute chart this entire week every single day Friday the previous week Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday I did every single day forcasted with annotations proving proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that there's no noise on the lower time frames the algorithm will distort these charts not because it's hiding because it's doing it's not other words it's not I don't believe it's a mechanism that creating um like this it's not like masking or cloaking what it's trying to do because it's you can really clearly see what it's doing with the bu side of the curve on the left side of the curve I'm sorry on the left side of the curve with the buy areas here every down Clos candle sets up the next move up these are those are your frame of reference you just carry those over to the right side of the chart and then it unlocks everything what they bought here they have to mitigate with going short what they bought here they have to mitigate and go short targeting the liquidity over here don't spend that much time with all these candles because the length of time it draws out like for instance if this would have been like say it's a uh 30 second chart man this thing would be even longer it would be twice you know twice as long and if it's a u two second chart okay whatever the interval you want to use all these candles would just be multiplied in the the number of them before we saw this move here so again that's why I say the chart or the time frame is not the important factor it's understanding the delivery of price because once you understand what they're doing they're running from this area here pricing in up to the fair value Gap once that fair value Gap is tagged they're selling short they're adding more shorts they're adding more shorts and then the displacement and there's your weekly High all of this builds with more examples obviously but nonetheless tape reading in the clearest definition I can provide for you is understanding the EB and flow of the micro dealing ranges that create As Time Goes By The Floor Traders they would always have a little pad in their hands they would have their floor numbers which is basically pivot numbers back then and then what they would monitor was the intraday highs and lows every time they ticked up and made a new high for the day they'd write that number down and if it made another High 5 minutes later they would write it down so in their mind they know what these ranges are and they operate on that basis they don't need a chart I didn't need a chart back in the 90s I was me looking at the CNBC ticker tape and I would know okay we just made another higher high and I knew what the previous day's high and low was and I knew where the previous day's close was I know what the previous day's open was why is that important because if I was working off a fair value Gap okay I could see all that stuff based on the just the price action ticking by every 10 minutes and I didn't need to have a chart in front of me and that's why I was confident to trade on the road while I was working because I did not have charts I just had numbers flashing on a little machine it was it was a quote machine it's all it's like a little tiny little little bit bigger than my Android phone now and all it did was give me numbers the high the low and where it was and the volume that's it it's all it was showing me just that stuff it wasn't giving me any charts we didn't have the luxury of that stuff back then it was just analog device showing me numbers a range and that's how I traded so when I studied all of the things I was exposed to and filled in all the gaps with my retail understanding it unlocked everything on a chart so I can see inside this chart what would otherwise be confusing to anyone else if I showed this chart to um well I wouldn't I'm not going to go there if I show it to anybody else that claims the read price action they will not see the signatures that I'm showing you because it's you have to be exposed to certain things and then it unlocks but you're not going to find it studying charts you just not you won't you won't see it you won't see it that's why everybody out there walks around saying the same things you know intraday charts are just noise I've never found anybody that can trade consistently on a one minute chart or intraday chart well I'm sitting here I'm waving everybody hello here you here it is it can be done but you have to understand what you're doing which takes a great deal of effort and takes a lot of concentration and I already know this lesson probably feels like more confusion for you that was kind of like what I was feeling when I first saw cuz I knew I was seeing something but I couldn't quite figure it out and once I understood and was exposed to how interbank is priced that order flow it became completely obvious that side of the market which is above institutional level okay you have Central Bank above everybody then you have the large investment Banks that's your institutional guys the Goldman Sach boys the UBS guys they're under Central Bank they're puppets on a string okay they walk around with all the pump and the clout chasing and they're the big wigs and you know we're those smart money they're not the smart money they're just puppets on a string from the Central Bank level anytime that Central Bank wants to smack them around they can and they do and beneath the institutional level is the smaller Banks and insurance companies and larger Traders and you get into the retail Spectrum with brokerages and such and it gets all way down to the retail so they're not and it's not surprising when they say that when they look at intraday charts it's just noise because they've never been exposed to what I've been exposed to and it's not a matter of arrogance it's a matter of fact when you speak to someone and they know something fluidly it's completely obvious you know who knows what's going on but in large trending models okay large long-term trending models the institutional guys their stuff is good to follow because that's the the dance the central banks will be providing liquidity for those long-term moves but at the turning points they're going to be wrong they don't have the luxury of working in these lower time frames they're not permitted to look at these lower time frames their models are always on a daily and a weekly chart 90% of the time 90% of the time they're not allowed to use anything unless it's a uh a Trader that's exceptionally done well with their trading and they've been like more or less special privileges have been granted to that person usually at an Institutional level you have a model that you just have to follow they train you this is what we look for XYZ at this threshold we put this much allocation of risk in and there it is you can't you can't breach this level of risk if you do you got to kill it and if you violate it is as much as this much then you're gone and that's kind of like really minimizing it and oversimplifying it but that's pretty much what it is interbank doesn't have that it's this is the way it's going to be like it or not Market's going to do this this this and there it is if you didn't catch it too bad this is the truth of it all so if you look at price and we remove all of the noise in here okay all the noise has been removed because we understand the ranges that price is working within relative to the left side of the curve which is previous reaccumulation of Longs carry those ranges over and then I'm watching how price moves in or out of that range it's as simple as that now Watch What Happens the body of the candle because that's the bulk of the volume in the reaccumulation of Longs cuz there's accumulation alongs down here you may not catch this displacement this is where you would have caught the long or should have and then rallies up reaccumulation of new Longs rallies up here this body or the candle's body here that close is the bottom of the range I'm looking for when we break out of it right there okay who cares what candle it does it in I'm looking at the range so when everybody else is watching these candles paint here I'm staring at that that's the bottom of the range if that breaks away and it does here that creates what displacement we've left this area of where it was previously reaccumulation alongs they have done their dirty work they have now established or they should have already established new shorts this displacement creates what an imbalance there's your fair value Gap here's the candle's High you want to reach above you can sell short there and look for the liquidity resting below these equal lows 10 20 15 whatever the PIP uh value you have faith in and it runs the low here is 12270 10 Pips below that would be 12260 12259 it's only off by one pip on a one minute chart that's supposed to be just noise the market goes over here creates a lower low low is 122 51 and again just for uh completeness sake the low is 70 so 20 Pips would be what 50 Pips I'm sorry 12250 and then the low forms at 12251 it's only off B pip for a one minute chart that's supposed to be just noise you're going to you're going to encounter a lot of people that are going to not believe what you are learning but they can't argue with the facts of me being able to do it what I just showed you here was just a variable of what I did in euro dollar that's how I flipped and got myself in sync with the big move that just you know just tanked it this sell off in here I was watching the smaller ranges and once the range broke it created an imbalance right in here and it created a small imbalance in here but I wanted to see the range break and then right in here sold short and then I'm in here short but it went up just a little bit more because I'm masking I don't want people looking at what I'm doing and trying to figure it all out because I'm I'm convinced there's some smart people out there I'm not the smartest person in the world that's for sure but that was what I did I priced in what the expectation was relative with what I just said here tape reading and this little punch up in here got everybody excited thinking it created the low and then I set it right on the video and annotations you it's getting ready to go hard down like it was getting ready to break hard and it's all based on the market maker cell model so I know I already know that this lesson creates all kinds of questions and that's good because that's what you want to learn you want to learn and the way you know you're learning is because you you have barriers in your understanding and then they'll be filled in with more examples okay but for now just know that when I look at a one minute chart I'm not confused by all by all this because I'm I have specific frames of reference which you have already been taught in the core content I'm just showing you how to apply them correctly
