# Ashton's CBDR + ASIA Range SD Method
## Date Developed: January 20, 2026
## Result: +$277.45 GBPUSD, +$156.01 GBPJPY (passed FTMO Verification #2)

---

## Overview

Combines ICT's CBDR (Central Bank Dealer Range) with ASIA range standard deviation extensions to find high-probability entry zones and targets. Works best on early week (Mon-Wed) when weekly high/low is forming.

---

## The Components

### 1. CBDR Range (Prior Day)
- Measured from 2pm-8pm EST (prior day)
- Calculate standard deviations: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 SD
- Extensions project from range high/low

### 2. ASIA Range (Current Day)
- Measured from 7pm-12am EST (Asian session)
- Same SD calculations
- Fresh liquidity levels for current day

### 3. Confluence Zones
- **KEY INSIGHT**: When CBDR SDs and ASIA SDs align at similar price levels = high probability zone
- Example from Jan 20: CBDR-1SD aligned with ASIA-3SD for target

---

## Entry Logic

1. **Identify Bias**: Early week bullish restructuring → looking for high of week
2. **Mark Ranges**: Plot prior day CBDR and current ASIA range with SD extensions
3. **Find Confluence**: Where do extensions from both ranges align?
4. **Wait for Liquidity Sweep**: Price must sweep highs/lows first
5. **Enter at PD Array**: FVG + OB combo after sweep
6. **Confirm with Displacement**: Need bullish/bearish FVG to confirm direction

---

## Target Logic

- Opposite SD extensions become targets
- Example: If entering LONG after sweep of lows, target the SD extensions ABOVE
- CBDR-1SD + ASIA-3SD alignment = strong target
- BSL/SSL at these levels = liquidity magnet

## Jan 20, 2026 Trade Example (GBPUSD)

### Setup:
| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Prior CBDR Range | 65 pips |
| ASIA Range | Calculated |
| Target Zone | CBDR-1SD aligned with ASIA-3SD |

### Entry Sequence:
1. Price made new high (BSL taken)
2. At 00:00 (new day), dropped 20 pips
3. Fell directly into 15M FVG + OB zone
4. OB = last down candle before bullish displacement
5. OB was INSIDE the FVG (double confluence)
6. Bullish displacement confirmed → ENTER LONG

### Result:
- Entry: 1.34354
- Target: 1.34900 (CBDR-1SD / ASIA-3SD)
- Pips: +37
- P&L: +$277.45

## What NOT To Do (Lesson from same day)

**Counter-trend short attempt failed because:**
- Had: Extension levels, Fib extensions, BSL alignment
- Missing: Bearish displacement
- Missing: Price taking out the low that created the high

**Rule**: Don't catch tops/bottoms without:
1. Displacement confirming the reversal
2. Liquidity taken on the other side first

---

## Time & Price Theory Integration

Best used when:
- Early week (Mon-Wed) - weekly high/low forming
- At times we expect movement (London open, NY open)
- With market restructuring visible on HTF
- PD Array (FVG+OB) at SD confluence zone
