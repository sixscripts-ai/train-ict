# A+ Template Trade: Displacement Follow-Through

This file documents the exact specifications of the A+ template trade based on Ashton's 
January 16, 2026 EUR/USD Short trade that passed the FTMO challenge.

## The Template Trade

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | January 16, 2026 |
| **Pair** | EUR/USD |
| **Direction** | SHORT |
| **Entry** | 1.16195 (4H FVG zone) |
| **Stop** | 1.16325 (above last up candle, 13 pips) |
| **Target** | 1.15890 (Asian low / CBDR extension, 30.6 pips) |
| **R:R** | 2.35 |
| **Result** | WIN (+$612.75) |
| **Duration** | ~4.5 hours |
| **Grade** | A+ (7/7 confluences) |

## The 7 Confluences

1. **Prior Displacement** - Jan 15 bearish displacement established the bias
2. **4H Fair Value Gap** - Primary entry zone (retracement into imbalance)
3. **15M Order Block** - Secondary confluence zone
4. **15M Fair Value Gap** - Confluent with the 15M OB
5. **CBDR Setup** - Range established for extension calculation
6. **Asian Range Sweep** - Highs taken = trigger for shorts
7. **Clear Liquidity Target** - Asian low = draw on liquidity

## Critical Rules

### Entry
- Enter at the **4H FVG** as primary zone
- Be aware of **15M OB + FVG** as secondary (deeper) zone
- Plan stop to survive test of both zones

### Stop Placement
**"Stop above the last UP candle before the DOWN move"**

This is the KEY insight. The stop must:
- Be above the last opposing candle before displacement
- Account for potential 15M zone retest
- NOT just be "X pips above entry"

### Target
**CBDR extension from opposite range = Asian low (for shorts)**

The target is the opposite side of the Asian range, which also aligns with CBDR extension.

### Session Timing
- London / NY Overlap is ideal
- Can enter during London and let run into NY
