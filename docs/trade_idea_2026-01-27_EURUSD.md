Trade idea: EUR/USD — 2026-01-27 (from attached 5m chart)

Chart context
- Timeframe: 5-minute intraday snapshot.
- Recent action: a strong impulse up to a fresh short-term high, followed by a sustained pullback and consolidation into the mid-range.
- Visible structure: clear impulsive leg up (buy-side liquidity taken), then a distribution/congestion zone and a downstream retracement toward a prior balance/0.5 area.
- HTF context (inferred): short-term momentum was bullish into the high, but failure/rejection created a bearish short-term bias on the 5m/15m.

High-level read
- Short-term bias: Neutral→Bearish at resistance/rejection. The impulse up created liquidity; price failed to hold highs and has returned into value.
- Probabilities favor selling into failure/retests of the prior breakout/upper distribution (0.5–0.618 retrace or prior SD level) for a momentum continuation lower, unless price reclaims the high with strong follow-through.

Primary trade idea — Sell-on-retest (higher-probability)
- Rationale: after the high failed, a retest of the liquidity/SD area provides a low-risk zone to fade the failed breakout and capture the move back to the structure/low.
- Entry zone: short limit or short on confirmed rejection at the 0.5–0.618 retracement / prior distribution line (approx the blue horizontal area in the chart). Prefer a 5m rejection candle (pin, bearish engulfing) or 15m confirmation.
- Alternate trigger: aggressive entry on a clean bearish break below the local support (measured on 5m) with momentum.
- Stop: just above the local swing high / above the prior distribution zone (keep stop tight to the structure; approximate distance 25–45 pips depending on exact entry).
- Targets:
  - TP1: prior intra-session low / structure low (first support) — take ~30–50% off.
  - TP2: measured extension toward lower liquidity cluster / daily value low — hold remainder (2–3× TP1 distance possible).
- Position sizing: risk 0.5–1% account on initial stop. Scale size if using laddered entries.
- Expected RR: with ~30 pip risk, TP1 ≈ 35–60 pips (1.1–2R), TP2 ≈ 90–120 pips (3–4R).

Execution and management
- Confirm rejection on 5m or 15m (wick rejection, bearish engulf, or structure flip). If no clear rejection, skip.
- If entry hits, move stop to breakeven after TP1 partial, trail remainder below successive swing lows or use a volatility-based ATR trail.
- If price breaks and reclaims the high with strong momentum, exit and consider long only on confirmed reclaim (invalidates short plan).

Alternative setups
- Momentum breakout long: if price reclaims and closes above the prior high with strong follow-through, enter long on retest of breakout (stop below breakout candle) targeting new highs.
- Range scalp: if price stays choppy between the distribution line and the low, prefer small scalps respecting structure and tight stops.

Risk notes
- Watch news and sessions — sudden moves can blow stops. Avoid entries within 5–10 minutes of high-impact prints if possible.
- If 15m shows clear bullish reclaim, avoid shorting; the pose of the trade flips.
