## EURUSD Long (0:01 - 2:57)

### Structure Identification
```
Distribution → Leg 1-2-3 → TERMINUS → Reversal → Prior Distribution → ACCUMULATION
```

### Timeline:
- **0:01** - Identifies Buy Model forming: distribution, leg 1-2-3, terminus
- **0:17** - Price returns to prior distribution, expecting accumulation
- **0:17** - CBDR range from Jan 18 referenced
- **0:56** - Asian range forms, structure break at highs
- **1:34** - Expansion breaks range, FVG forms
- **1:52** - "Last down candle before the up move = Order Block with FVG"
- **2:14** - "Price hits the order block perfectly at 50%"
- **2:28** - Entry taken, expansion follows - "Textbook"

### Entry Criteria Met:
1. ✅ Buy model structure (terminus → reversal)
2. ✅ CBDR range identified (Jan 18)
3. ✅ Asian range structure break (bullish)
4. ✅ FVG formed on expansion
5. ✅ Order Block = last down candle before displacement
6. ✅ Entry at 50% of OB inside FVG
7. ✅ London session timing

### Targets:
- Equal highs (liquidity)
- CBDR extension above prior distribution

### Key Quote:
> "Price hits the order block perfectly at 50%... Textbook, where's our liquidity going? The extensions. So we're mixing extensions, time and price, PDA."

## GBPUSD Long (2:57 - 3:49)

### Structure Identification
```
Terminus → Prior Distribution → "What buys will sell, what sells will buy" → Range Break → Accumulation
```

### Timeline:
- **2:57** - Higher timeframe terminus identified
- **3:26** - Prior distribution zone marked
- **3:27** - "What buys will sell, what sells will buy"
- **3:27** - Specific candle breaks range → bias shifts to BUYS
- **3:49** - Price drops to extension during London
- **3:49** - "Judas swing down" - fake move before real expansion
- **3:49** - 5-minute Order Block entry
- **3:49** - "Order block, expansion, displacement, easy money"

### Entry Criteria Met:
1. ✅ Terminus on HTF
2. ✅ Prior distribution = future accumulation
3. ✅ Range break candle confirms direction
4. ✅ Accumulation zone (time and price)
5. ✅ Judas swing (fake dip)
6. ✅ 5M Order Block for precision entry
7. ✅ London session timing

### Key Quote:
> "What buys will sell, what sells will buy... Order block, expansion, displacement, easy money."

## ICT Concepts Applied

### 1. Buy Model Structure
```
Distribution → 1-2-3 Leg → Terminus → Reversal → Prior Distribution → Accumulation
```

### 2. "What Buys Will Sell, What Sells Will Buy"
- Prior distribution zones become accumulation on reversal
- The same zone that distributed (sold) will now accumulate (buy)

### 3. 50% Order Block Entry
- Order Block = last down candle before displacement
- Enter at 50% (midpoint) of the OB
- Must be inside or overlapping with FVG

### 4. Judas Swing
- Fake move in opposite direction before true expansion
- London session dip before bullish continuation
- Used to trap shorts and grab liquidity

### 5. Time + Price Confluence
- CBDR extensions (price)
- Asian range levels (price)
- London session timing (time)
- Must align for A+ setup

### 6. PDA Arrays (Price Delivery Arrays)
- Stack multiple confluences:
  - FVG
  - Order Block
  - CBDR/ASIA extensions
  - Liquidity levels
