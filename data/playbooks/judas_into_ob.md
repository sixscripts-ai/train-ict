# Judas Swing Into OB Playbook
# London Open Manipulation Model

## Prerequisites
- [ ] It's London killzone (2:00 AM - 5:00 AM EST)
- [ ] HTF bias is clear (Daily/4H direction known)
- [ ] Key levels marked (OBs, FVGs, liquidity pools)

---

## What is Judas Swing?
**100% TIME-BASED** - The fake move at London open that:
1. Traps counter-trend traders
2. Sweeps liquidity (stops)
3. Then reverses to true direction

---

## Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. PRE-SESSION MARKUP (Hours Before, Not Minutes)
- [ ] Mark CBDR (2 PM - 8 PM EST prior day)
- [ ] Mark ASIA range (8 PM - 12 AM EST)
- [ ] Identify: Tight CBDR/ASIA = expansion expected
- [ ] Draw premium/discount zones
- [ ] Mark BSL/SSL pools (equal highs/lows)

### 2. WAIT FOR LONDON OPEN
- [ ] Clock shows 2:00 AM EST
- [ ] Watch for initial move (often opposite of HTF bias)
- [ ] This IS the Judas swing starting

### 3. IDENTIFY THE SWEEP
- [ ] Price takes out visible liquidity (sweeps stops)
- [ ] 20-30 pips through level is normal
- [ ] Can be wick OR body - sweep is "fluid, destined"

### 4. SPOT THE DISPLACEMENT
- [ ] Sharp reversal after sweep
- [ ] FVG forms in opposite direction
- [ ] OB forms (last candle before displacement)

### 5. ENTRY SETUP
- [ ] Wait for retrace to OB/FVG zone
- [ ] Check: Does this align with HTF bias? Y/N
- [ ] Correlation confirmation ready

### 6. EXECUTE
- [ ] Entry: 50% of OB (or FVG touch)
- [ ] Stop: Beyond Judas swing high/low
- [ ] Target: Liquidity on other side of range

## Timing Rules

| TIME (EST) | ACTION |
|---|---|
| Before 2:00 AM | Markup only, no trades |
| 2:00 - 2:30 AM | Watch for Judas swing forming |
| 2:30 - 3:30 AM | Prime entry window after Judas completes |
| 3:30 - 5:00 AM | Later entries okay if structure holds |
| After 5:00 AM | London killzone over, wait for NY |

---

## If-Then Rules

| IF | THEN |
|---|---|
| Move at 2 AM goes WITH HTF bias | Probably NOT Judas - wait |
| Move at 2 AM goes AGAINST HTF bias | This is the Judas - prepare |
| Sweep happens but no displacement | Not valid yet - wait |
| Time is NOT 2-5 AM EST | NOT a Judas swing by definition |
| CBDR was wide (60+ pips) | Less likely to get clean Judas |

---

## Judas Swing Characteristics
- Happens at session open (London)
- Opposite to daily/weekly trend
- Grabs liquidity (stops from overnight longs/shorts)
- Creates the OB/FVG for real entry

---

## Notes
- Judas timing is NOT flexible - it's the open
- Don't confuse random moves with Judas
- If you miss the Judas retrace, wait for NY AM
