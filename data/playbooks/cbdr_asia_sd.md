# CBDR + ASIA Standard Deviation Playbook
# Ashton's Signature Model

## What This Model Does
Uses pre-session range measurements (CBDR and ASIA) to:
1. Predict expansion direction
2. Identify high-probability entry zones
3. Project targets using standard deviation

---

## Prerequisites
- [ ] CBDR tracked (2 PM - 8 PM EST prior day)
- [ ] ASIA range tracked (8 PM - 12 AM EST)
- [ ] Standard deviation levels calculated
- [ ] Terminus identified on HTF

---

## Key Concepts

### CBDR (Central Bank Dealers Range)
- Time: 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST
- Ideal: <40 pips (preferably 20-30)
- Tight CBDR = Expansion coming in London/NY

### ASIA Range
- Time: 8:00 PM - 12:00 AM EST
- Often more important than CBDR
- ASIA SD levels = key support/resistance

### Standard Deviation Projections
- 1 SD = 1x the range added to high/low
- 2 SD = 2x the range
- These become targets

---

## Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. MEASURE CBDR (Before 8 PM EST)
- [ ] Mark CBDR high: _______
- [ ] Mark CBDR low: _______
- [ ] Calculate range: _______ pips
- [ ] Assessment: Tight (<40)? Y/N

### 2. MEASURE ASIA (After 12 AM EST)
- [ ] Mark ASIA high: _______
- [ ] Mark ASIA low: _______
- [ ] Calculate range: _______ pips
- [ ] Note: Is ASIA range > CBDR? Y/N

### 3. CALCULATE SD LEVELS
For Bullish Bias:
- [ ] 1 SD above ASIA high: _______
- [ ] 2 SD above ASIA high: _______

For Bearish Bias:
- [ ] 1 SD below ASIA low: _______
- [ ] 2 SD below ASIA low: _______

### 4. IDENTIFY HTF CONFLUENCE
- [ ] Where is terminus?
- [ ] Does SD level align with terminus? Y/N
- [ ] FVG or OB at SD level? Y/N

### 5. WAIT FOR ENTRY TRIGGER
- [ ] London/NY opens
- [ ] Price sweeps one side of ASIA
- [ ] Returns to ASIA SD zone

### 6. EXECUTE
- [ ] Entry: ASIA SD level (with OB/FVG)
- [ ] Stop: Beyond ASIA range high/low
- [ ] Target 1: 1 SD opposite side
- [ ] Target 2: 2 SD opposite side or terminus

## Reading CBDR/ASIA

| CBDR | ASIA | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Tight (<40) | Tight | Strong expansion likely |
| Tight | Wide | Already moving, direction set |
| Wide | Tight | Watch ASIA for setup |
| Wide | Wide | Range day likely, be careful |

---

## If-Then Rules

| IF | THEN |
|---|---|
| CBDR < 30 pips | High probability expansion day |
| ASIA contained in CBDR | Very tight - big move coming |
| Price breaks ASIA before London | Direction may be set early |
| ASIA SD lines up with HTF OB | Prime entry zone |
| Wide CBDR (60+ pips) | Expansion already happened or no max threshold if structure good |

---

## The "Tight CBDR" Signal
When CBDR is tight:
1. Market is coiling
2. Smart money accumulating
3. Expansion is coming
4. Question is: Which direction?

Answer: Use HTF bias + terminus + Judas swing

---

## Notes
- CBDR/ASIA is CONTEXT, not entry signal alone
- Combine with OB/FVG for actual entry
- SD levels are TARGETS and ZONES
- Wide doesn't mean bad - just means expansion coming, direction TBD
