# LTF Refinement Playbook
# When You're Late on the Higher Timeframe

## When to Use This
- You identified HTF setup but entry already passed
- Price moved without you
- HTF PDA (OB/FVG) already hit or too far away
- You want to still catch the move with lower risk

---

## The Rule
> "If I'm late on the 15-minute entry, I drop to 5-minute and find the next PDA that promotes my higher timeframe bias."

---

## Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. CONFIRM HTF BIAS IS INTACT
- [ ] Structure still holding (no new BOS against you)
- [ ] Price is ABOVE origination displacement (for longs)
- [ ] Price is BELOW origination displacement (for shorts)
- [ ] Terminus not yet reached

### 2. DROP TO LOWER TIMEFRAME
- [ ] Switch from 15M → 5M (or 1H → 15M)
- [ ] Same HTF bias, just finer entry

### 3. FIND LTF PDA
- [ ] Look for 5M FVG in direction of HTF bias
- [ ] Look for 5M OB in direction of HTF bias
- [ ] Must be UNMITIGATED

### 4. VALIDATE LTF PDA
- [ ] Does it PROMOTE HTF direction? Y/N
- [ ] Is it in a reasonable zone (not extended)?
- [ ] Does price structure support entry here?

### 5. EXECUTE
- [ ] Entry: LTF OB 50% or FVG
- [ ] Stop: Below LTF OB (tighter than HTF would be)
- [ ] Target: Same as original HTF target

## TF Hierarchy for Refinement

| Original TF | Refinement TF |
|---|---|
| 4H | 1H or 15M |
| 1H | 15M |
| 15M | 5M |
| 5M | 1M (aggressive) |

---

## If-Then Rules

| IF | THEN |
|---|---|
| HTF OB was 50 pips away, now 20 pips | LTF refinement makes sense |
| Price already hit HTF OB and moved | Look for LTF continuation PDA |
| No LTF PDA visible | Skip - don't force it |
| LTF PDA goes AGAINST HTF bias | IGNORE IT - only trade with HTF |
| Origination displacement broken | No refinement - thesis dead |

## Benefits of LTF Refinement
1. Tighter stop loss (less pips at risk)
2. Better R:R ratio possible
3. Still captures HTF move
4. Valid when you'd otherwise miss the trade

## Risks of LTF Refinement
1. More false signals on LTF
2. Might get stopped then see HTF move work
3. Requires fast execution

---

## Notes
- LTF refinement is a TOOL, not a habit
- Don't use it to justify FOMO entries
- Best when HTF structure is crystal clear
- If unsure, just wait for next clean HTF setup
