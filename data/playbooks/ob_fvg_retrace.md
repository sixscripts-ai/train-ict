# OB + FVG Retrace Playbook
# Ashton's Core Entry Model

## Prerequisites
- [ ] HTF bias confirmed (Daily/4H showing clear direction)
- [ ] Range identified (premium zone for sells, discount zone for buys)
- [ ] Terminus predetermined BEFORE price approaches

---

## Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. IDENTIFY STRUCTURE BREAK
- [ ] BOS occurred on 15M or higher
- [ ] Body closed beyond previous swing (not just wick)
- [ ] Break sustained (not flash wick that reversed)

### 2. SPOT THE DISPLACEMENT
- [ ] Strong move away from break (3+ candles same direction)
- [ ] FVG formed during displacement
- [ ] OB formed = last opposite candle before move

### 3. MARK YOUR LEVELS
- [ ] FVG high: _______
- [ ] FVG low: _______
- [ ] FVG 50%: _______
- [ ] OB high: _______
- [ ] OB low: _______
- [ ] OB 50% (ENTRY): _______

### 4. WAIT FOR RETRACE
- [ ] Price returning to FVG zone
- [ ] Check: Is 50% OB inside the FVG? (Ideal)
- [ ] If late on HTF → drop to 5M for next LTF PDA

### 5. ENTRY CONFIRMATION
- [ ] Price reaches 50% of OB
- [ ] Wait for candle to FILL (not just wick)
- [ ] Correlation confirmation (GBPJPY, EURJPY, etc.)

### 6. EXECUTE
- [ ] Entry: 50% of OB
- [ ] Stop: Below OB specifically (NOT entire FVG)
- [ ] Target 1: Previous swing high/low
- [ ] Target 2: Equal highs/lows OR terminus

## If-Then Rules

| IF | THEN |
|---|---|
| Price wicks into FVG but doesn't fill | WAIT - not valid entry |
| Price closes below OB (longs) | INVALIDATED - move on |
| Correlation pair NOT confirming | WAIT or skip trade |
| Late on 15M entry | Drop to 5M, find next PDA |
| Price returns ABOVE origination displacement | Re-entry still valid |
| Price drops BELOW origination displacement | Thesis invalid - move done |

---

## Stop Placement Rules
1. Below OB only - NOT below entire FVG
2. Give it room but not too much
3. If OB is massive, consider LTF refinement

---

## Notes
- Higher TF OBs are stronger
- FVG+OB confluence > FVG alone > OB alone
- Algorithm respects THE VOID (FVG) most
