## Trading Style

### Primary Models
1. **Displacement Follow-Through** (A+ Template)
2. Weekly Sell Model
3. **CBDR + ASIA Range SD Method** (Signature Model - documented Jan 20)

### Favorite Pairs
- EURUSD (primary)
- GBPUSD (secondary)

### Session
- London/NY Overlap preferred

---

## A+ Setup Requirements (Personal Template)

1. Prior displacement establishes bias
2. 4H Fair Value Gap as entry zone
3. 15M Order Block + 15M FVG confluence
4. CBDR setup present
5. Asian range liquidity sweep
6. Clear target (opposite range / CBDR extension)
7. Stop above/below last opposing candle

**When all 7 align: SIZE UP and TRUST IT**

---

## Entry Execution Rules (Captured Jan 20, 2026)

### Confirmation Before Entry:
- Wait for candle to **fill the zone** (not first touch)
- Use **correlation confirmation** (e.g., GBPJPY new high = GBP bulls confirmed)

### Stop Placement:
- Stop goes **below OB specifically**, not entire FVG
- Tighter stop = better R:R

### Timeframe Selection:
- If FVG mitigated on HTF → drop to **LTF (5M) for refined entry**
- This is PDA Array concept - zone "activated", need precision

### Terminus Identification:
- **"The high that made the low got taken out = Restructuring"**
- Structure shift confirms reversal, not just swing

### Session Prep:
- CBDR and ASIA tracked **BEFORE** session
- **Don't trade during CBDR** - it's accumulation
- ASIA range more important for expansion thesis
- SD levels are predetermined before London/NY

## Key Lessons Learned

### Jan 20, 2026 (VERIFICATION PASSED - FUNDED)
> "The CBDR + ASIA SD confluence is my edge. When terminus forms after extended move, wait for re-accumulation, then enter at the SD zone with tight CBDR."

### Jan 16, 2026 (A+ Session)
> "When you and I agree on a setup together - you, me, and VEX - and we actually look at the charts, plot them properly, and talk about it... we are UNSTOPPABLE."

### Risk Management
- Smart stop placement accounts for potential deeper retests
- Don't panic when price tests secondary zones
- Trust the structure

### Psychology
- Can sleep through trades when thesis is A+
- More confident = better results
- Follow the process, not emotions
