# ICT Buy Model & Sell Model - Master Notes

## 🎯 CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM USER
**"The Buy/Sell Models are the MACRO FRAMEWORK. Everything else (FVG, OB, liquidity, market structure) are components that fit WITHIN the model at specific stages."**

The user explained:
> "Stuff like FVG entries, liquidity sweeps, market structure shifts - that's all inside of the buy and sell models. It's what we're at in that point in the model that determines when we look for those entry patterns."

**WORKFLOW:**
1. First: Identify WHICH model we're in (Buy or Sell)
2. Second: Determine WHERE in that model we are (accumulation, manipulation, distribution)
3. Third: THEN incorporate time + look for entry patterns (FVG, OB)
4. Fourth: Identify the liquidity target (FVG above/below liquidity = valid trade)

## 📊 MARKET MAKER SELL MODEL (MMSM)

### Overview
Blueprint for price delivery from **Bearish PD Array to Bullish PD Array**
Used when HTF structure is bearish, next draw on liquidity is lower

### Four Stages:

#### Stage 1: Original Consolidation (Accumulation)
- Price ranges between two limits
- Smart money building SHORT positions
- Retail traders accumulating longs at support

#### Stage 2: Engineering Liquidity (Manipulation Setup)
- Price makes HIGHER LOWS creating buy-side liquidity
- Each HL becomes stops for shorts / entries for breakout longs
- This is the "trap" being set

#### Stage 3: Smart Money Reversal (Judas/Manipulation)
- Price spikes ABOVE consolidation highs
- Sweeps buy-side liquidity (BSL)
- Triggers breakout buyers' entries and short sellers' stops
- THIS IS THE FALSE MOVE

#### Stage 4: Liquidity Hunt (Distribution/Expansion)
- Price reverses sharply DOWN
- Displacement through structure
- Targets the engineered liquidity (all those higher lows)
- Finally delivers to original consolidation low or beyond (SSL)

### Entry Logic:
- Wait for Stage 3 (liquidity sweep above)
- Look for MSS (Market Structure Shift) on LTF
- Enter on FVG/OB retracement that forms BELOW the swept liquidity
- Target: Sell-side liquidity (old lows, SSL pools)

## 📈 MARKET MAKER BUY MODEL (MMBM)

### Overview
Blueprint for price delivery from **Bullish PD Array to Bearish PD Array**
Used when HTF structure is bullish, next draw on liquidity is higher

### Prerequisites:
1. HTF market structure = BULLISH
2. Next draw on liquidity = HIGHER
3. Sell program on LTF reaching into HTF bullish PD array

### Four Stages:

#### Stage 1: Original Consolidation (Accumulation)
- Price ranges between limits
- Smart money building LONG positions
- Retail selling at resistance

#### Stage 2: Engineering Liquidity
- Price makes LOWER HIGHS creating sell-side liquidity
- Each LH becomes stops for longs / entries for breakdown shorts
- Creating the trap

#### Stage 3: Smart Money Reversal (Judas/Manipulation)
- Price spikes BELOW consolidation lows
- Sweeps sell-side liquidity (SSL)
- Triggers breakdown sellers' entries and long holders' stops
- THE FALSE MOVE

#### Stage 4: Liquidity Hunt (Distribution/Expansion)
- Price reverses sharply UP
- Displacement through structure
- Runs through all engineered lower highs
- Delivers to original consolidation high or beyond (BSL)

### Entry Logic:
- Wait for Stage 3 (liquidity sweep below)
- Look for MSS (Market Structure Shift) on LTF
- Enter on FVG/OB retracement that forms ABOVE the swept liquidity
- Target: Buy-side liquidity (old highs, BSL pools)

## ⚡ POWER OF THREE (AMD) - Daily Application

### The Three Phases:
1. **Accumulation**: Day opens, price ranges near open, SM builds positions
2. **Manipulation**: False move opposite to daily bias (Judas Swing)
3. **Distribution**: Real move delivering to daily target

### Bullish Day AMD:
- Accumulation near open
- Manipulation: Drops BELOW open, sweeps old lows (SSL)
- Distribution: Rallies UP, targets old highs (BSL)
- Daily candle = bullish body with wick below open

### Bearish Day AMD:
- Accumulation near open
- Manipulation: Spikes ABOVE open, sweeps old highs (BSL)
- Distribution: Sells off DOWN, targets old lows (SSL)
- Daily candle = bearish body with wick above open

## 🔑 KEY TRADING RULES

### What Constitutes a Valid Trade:
> "Look for FVG ABOVE the liquidity or BELOW it, so that way it has the target we're looking for."

Translation:
- **Sell Setup**: FVG forms ABOVE a liquidity pool (target is BELOW)
- **Buy Setup**: FVG forms BELOW a liquidity pool (target is ABOVE)
- The liquidity pool IS the target - if there's no draw on liquidity, there's no trade

### Timeframe Hierarchy:
- **15M**: Spot liquidity pools and model structure
- **5M or lower**: MSS confirmation and entry execution
- **HTF (4H/Daily)**: Confirm overall bias and model direction

### Entry Sequence:
1. Identify model (Buy or Sell) from HTF
2. Wait for manipulation phase (liquidity sweep)
3. Confirm MSS with displacement on LTF
4. Enter on FVG/OB retracement
5. Stop below/above last swing
6. Target opposite liquidity

## 🎯 USER'S CURRENT TRADES AS EXAMPLES

### Trade #1: EUR/USD SHORT (Sell Model)
- **Model Stage**: Distribution phase of sell model
- **Evidence**: DXY showing buy model (accumulation) = inverse correlation
- **Entry Pattern**: FVG above liquidity, targeting SSL below
- **Target**: Sell-side liquidity at lower levels

### Trade #2: GBP/USD SHORT (Sell Model)
- **Model Stage**: Same - distribution phase
- **Correlation**: Confirms EU sell model thesis via DXY
- **Entry**: LTF structure break with displacement

---

## 💡 CORRELATION FRAMEWORK

When analyzing pairs:
- **EUR/USD SELL MODEL** = **DXY BUY MODEL** (inverse)
- **GBP/USD SELL MODEL** = **DXY BUY MODEL** (inverse)

If DXY is in accumulation of buy model → EU/GU likely in distribution of sell model

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Looking for entries without identifying the model first
2. Trading FVGs that don't have a liquidity target
3. Entering during accumulation (too early)
4. Chasing manipulation moves (the Judas)
5. Not waiting for displacement + MSS confirmation
6. Trading against the model direction

---

## 📝 SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

Before any trade, ask:
1. What model are we in? (Buy or Sell)
2. What stage of the model? (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution)
3. Has manipulation (liquidity sweep) occurred?
4. Is there MSS with displacement?
5. Where is the FVG/OB relative to liquidity?
6. What is the target (draw on liquidity)?
7. Does time align (Killzone)?
