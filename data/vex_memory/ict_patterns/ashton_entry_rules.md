# Ashton's ICT Entry Rules & Nuances

*Captured: January 20, 2026*

## Entry Confirmation (FVG+OB)
- **DO NOT** enter on first touch
- **Wait for candle to fill** the zone
- **Use correlation confirmation** - e.g., GBPJPY making new high confirms GBP bulls before taking GBPUSD long
- Entry is a 2-step process: Zone touch + Confirmation

## Pre-Session Markup
- Distribution/accumulation boxes are drawn **BEFORE** the trade
- This is prep work, not hindsight analysis
- Mark HTF levels before session opens
- Markup done **HOURS before** session (not 15-30 mins)

## Stop Placement
- Stop goes **below the OB specifically**, not the entire FVG
- OB is the "last line of defense" - if that breaks, thesis is wrong
- This gives tighter stops and better R:R

## Timeframe Selection for Entry
- If **late on HTF entry** → drop to LTF (5M) to find next PDA that promotes HTF directional bias
- LTF PDA must align with HTF bias
- This is how to catch moves you're late on without chasing

## Terminus Identification (THE Low/High)
- **Structure-based**: "The high that made the low got taken out = Restructuring"
- When the swing high that created the low gets taken → structure has shifted
- This confirms reversal, not just another swing
- **Terminus is PREDETERMINED** - identified before price reaches it
- Located at discount PD arrays / old lows (for sells) or premium PD arrays / old highs (for buys)

## Structure Break Definition
- **Breaks above AND sustains** = real structure break
- Flash wicks are usually **stop hunts**, not real breaks
- Need candle body to hold above level, not just wick

## CBDR vs ASIA Range
- **ASIA range is more important** for expansion thesis
- No "too wide" threshold - wide CBDR/ASIA signals expansion coming
- Wide ranges = price will move with intention
- ASIA defines the "coil" before London/NY expansion

## Session Timing
- CBDR and ASIA are tracked **BEFORE** the session starts
- **"We don't trade during CBDR"** - it's a ranging/accumulation period
- ASIA sets up before London/NY, so the SD levels are already determined
- Trading happens AFTER these ranges form, not during

## Correlation Trading
- Use correlated pairs to confirm direction
- GBPJPY new high = GBP strength confirmed → GBPUSD long has higher probability
- Don't trade in isolation

## Buy Model Structure (From Jan 20 Video)
```
Distribution → 1-2-3 Leg → TERMINUS → Reversal → Prior Distribution → ACCUMULATION
```
- The "1-2-3 Leg" = Market Maker Buy/Sell Model AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution)
- These are swing points in the model

## Re-Entry Criteria (Multiple Trades Same Pair)
- Valid for re-entry if: Price stays above origination displacement / outbreak zone / structure
- **Invalid** if: Price falls below its origination displacement outbreak zone / structure
- Structure holding = thesis still valid
- Structure broken = move is done

## "What Buys Will Sell, What Sells Will Buy"
- Prior distribution zones become accumulation on reversal
- The zone that distributed (sold) will now accumulate (buy)
- This is the ICT market maker cycle

## 50% Order Block Entry
- OB = last down candle (for longs) before displacement
- Enter at 50% (midpoint) of the OB candle
- OB must be inside or overlapping with FVG
- Quote: "Price hits the order block perfectly at 50%... Textbook"

## Judas Swing
- **100% time-based** - happens at London open
- Fake move in opposite direction before true expansion
- Must occur during specific time window to qualify
- Not just any pullback - timing is everything
- Traps counter-trend traders, grabs liquidity
- Then real expansion follows

## Time + Price Formula
- **Time:** London session (primary), NY AM (secondary)
- **Price:** CBDR extensions + Asian range levels + liquidity pools
- Both must align for A+ setup

## PDA Array Stacking
Stack multiple confluences:
1. FVG (fair value gap)
2. Order Block (last opposing candle)
3. CBDR/ASIA extensions
4. Liquidity levels (equal highs/lows)

Quote: "We're mixing extensions, time and price, PDA"
