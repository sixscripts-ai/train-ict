# Sell Model Liquidity Sweep Setup

## The Complete Picture (EUR/USD 15M Example - Jan 15, 2026)

### Step 1: Identify HTF Bias
- Higher timeframe is BEARISH
- Looking for sells, targeting previous lows

### Step 2: Equal Lows = Liquidity Target
- **Jan 13, ~11:00 to ~21:00**: Price creates EQUAL LOWS
- These are NOT support - they are LIQUIDITY
- Stop losses rest below equal lows
- This becomes the draw/target

### Step 3: The Sweep (Manipulation)
- Price drops, SWEEPS below the equal lows
- Takes out all the stops
- This is the "SSL SWEEP" - Sell Side Liquidity taken

### Step 4: Back Inside the Sell Zone (AMD)
- **Jan 15, ~02:00**: Price gets back inside a sell zone
- This is the DISTRIBUTION phase of AMD
- Accumulation → Manipulation (sweep) → Distribution

### Step 5: Displacement Creates Structure
- **Jan 15, ~07:00-09:00**: DISPLACEMENT happens
- Price moves aggressively - this is the 3rd leg
- Displacement creates:
  - **Bearish Order Block** (last UP candle before drop)
  - **Fair Value Gap** (imbalance from the aggressive move)

### Step 6: OB + FVG = Sensitive Zone
- When OB and FVG overlap/combine = HIGH PROBABILITY area
- Next time price returns to this zone = SELL opportunity
- The imbalance (FVG) + institutional footprint (OB) = confluence

## Key Recognition Points

1. **Equal lows are NOT support** - they are liquidity pools
2. **Sweep confirms smart money grabbed liquidity**
3. **Displacement = institutional commitment to direction**
4. **OB forms BECAUSE of displacement**
5. **FVG forms BECAUSE of displacement**
6. **Combined zone = where to look for re-entry**

## ASHTON'S CLARIFICATIONS (Jan 15, 2026)

### Equal Levels
- **NOT about perfect lines** - just similar lows/highs
- **2-3 candles at same area = liquidity pool** - "licking my chops"
- Don't need exact pip count - **functional, not technical**
- Usually see disbursement from first, comes back, then disbursement again
- "This is the part of our trading that's different. They don't teach this shit."

### Sweep
- **Doesn't need rejection candle** - stops are getting hit regardless
- 20-25-30 pips that knocks everybody out
- **Could be whole candle, not just wick**
- **Multiple candles = we don't like WICKS** (institutional/NFP)
- "Don't think of it as violent action - think of it as fluid process that is DESTINED"

### Displacement  
- **No ATR formula** - it's structure shift WITH SPEED
- Happens during **optimal entry times, sessions, Judas swings**
- "When we see force and structure shift with speed = displacement"
- **Can be sequential candles** - timeframe dependent
- Single candle could be Judas swing

### OB + FVG Relationship
- **NOT always together** - but happens quite a bit
- **FVG more common with displacement than OB**
- **Ashton focuses on FVG over OB**
- "I don't really care too much for order blocks"

### WHY FVG > OB
- **Algorithm is trying to bring price back to the VOID**
- "All it has to do is go to 50% of the imbalance to continue"
- FVG = where the movement is coming from
- That's why OB less important

## The Sequence
```
1. HTF Bearish bias established
2. Equal lows form (liquidity builds)
3. Price rallies (inducement)  
4. Price SWEEPS the lows (manipulation)
5. Price returns to premium (sell zone)
6. Displacement creates OB + FVG
7. Future entry: Sell at FVG (50% of imbalance)
```
